Debbie just hit the wall, she never had it all
One Prozac a day, husband's a CPA
Her dreams went out the door when she turned 24
Only been with one man, what happened to her plan?
She was gonna be an actress, she was gonna be a star
She was gonna shake her ass on the hood of Whitesnake’s car
Her yellow SUV is now the enemy
Looks at her average life, and nothing has been alright

Since Bruce Springsteen, Madonna
Way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie
And music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school
They tell her that she’s uncool
Cause she's still preoccupied
With 19, 19, 1985

[Verse 2]
She’s seen all the classics, she knows every line
Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, even Saint Elmo’s Fire
She rocked out to Wham, not a big Limp Bizkit fan
Thought she’d get a hand on a member of Duran Duran
Where’s the mini-skirt made of snake skin?
And who’s the other guy that's singing in Van Halen?
When did reality become TV?
Whatever happened to sitcoms, game shows?

[Hook]
On the radio was Springsteen, Madonna
Way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie
And music still on MTV

Cause she's still preoccupied

[Bridge]
She hates time, make it stop
When did Mötley Crüe become classic rock?
And when did Ozzy become an actor?
Please make this stop, stop, stop
And bring back

Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely

Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely

So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Before the morning sun, when life was lonely

Soon we'll be 30 years old

And I can tell them stories

Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me

Can we pretend that airplanes

I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you starin' at that phone in your lap
And you hopin' but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for if you had one chance?
So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late
I'm on my way, so don't close that gate
If I don't make that, then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Yeah, yeah, somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah, back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe, oh maybe, I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur—what's up, Bobby Ray?
So can I get a wish to end the politics?
And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes

A Nightmare On My Street,DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince,2002-11-26,"[Intro: Fresh Prince]
Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy you all know him, he had me scared as hell!
He comes to me at night after I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred!
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot outside he wears it anyway!
He's gone when I'm awake but he shows up when I'm sleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare; on my street!

[Verse 1: Fresh Prince]
It was a Saturday evening, if I remember it right
And we had just gotten back off tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and bum rush the movies
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready Rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life
That was all right though 'cause the lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theater set to ill
We saw Elm Street and man it was def
And everything seemed all right when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare, but on my street!

[Verse 2: Fresh Prince & Freddy Kruger]
It was burning in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat, man, I was buggin'
I checked the clock and it stopped at 12:30
It had melted, it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty
I went downstairs to grab some juice or a Coke
Flipped the TV off, and then I almost choked
When I heard this awful voice comin' from behind
It said, ""You turned off David Letterman, now you must die!""
Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was
Broke outside in my drawers and screamed, ""So long, cuz!""
Got halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screamin'
Then thought, ""Oh, I get it, I must be dreamin""
I strolled back home with a grin on my grill
I figured since this is a dream I might as well get ill
I walked in the house, the Big Bad Fresh Prince
But Freddy killed all that noise real quick
He grabbed me by my neck and said
""Here's what we'll do, we got a lot of work here, me and you
The souls of your friends you and I will claim
You've got the body, and I've got the brain""
I said, ""Yo Fred, I think you've got me all wrong
I ain't partners with nobody with nails that long!
Look, I'll be honest, man, this team won't work
The girls won't be on you, Fred your face is all burnt!""
I pat him on the shoulder said, ""Thanks for stopping by.""
Then I opened up the door and said, ""Take care guy!""
He got mad, drew back his arm, and slashed my shirt
I laughed at first, then thought, ""Hold up, that hurt!""
It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real
I said, ""Freddy, uh, pal, there's been an awful mistake here.""
No further words and then I darted upstairs
Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed
Pulled the covers up over my head
And said, ""Oh please do somethin' with Fred!""
He jumped on my bed, ripped through the covers with his claws
Tried to get me, but my alarm went off
And then silence! It was a whole new day
I thought, ""Huh, I wasn't scared of him anyway.""
Until I noticed those rips in my sheets
And that was proof that there had been a nightmare, on my street

Oh man, I gotta call Jeff, I gotta call Jeff
Come on, come on
Come on Jeff, answer
Come on, man

Bad Day,Daniel Powter,2005-02-22,"[Verse 1]
Where is the moment we needed the most?
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to gray
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Verse 2]
You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Chorus]
Because you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

[Verse 3]
Will you need a blue sky holiday?
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carryin' on

You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know

You're coming back down and you really don't mind

And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well, oh, that strong

So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I

I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

[Verse 2]
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

[Chorus 1]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust
Not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

[Bridge]
I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

[Chorus 2]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong

Now i can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright for once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside

Now i can't breathe
No, I can't sleep

Seeing you, it kills me now

How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb, without a soul
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

Wake me up, wake me up inside

Wake me up, bid my blood to run

Save me, save me from the nothing I've become

Can't Hold Us,Madilyn Bailey,2013-04-26,"Here we go back, this is the moment

Return of the mack, get up
What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the internet and checking a new hit
Get up! Thrift shop pimp strut walking
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious

Somewhere between like rocky and cosby
Sweatergang nope nope y'all can't copy
Yup. Bad, moonwalking, this here, is our party
My posse's been on broadway
And we did it, our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
I got that bob barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me
On my I-n-d-e-p-e-n-d-e-n-t hustler
Chasing dreams since I was 14 with the four track bussing
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crushing

And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed to a great white shark on shark week
Raw. Gell me go up. gone!
Deuces goodbye. I got a world to see, and my guy he wanna see Rome
Ceasar make you a believer
Nah I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people

Raise those hands, this is a party
We came here to live life like nobody's watching

Castle On The Hill,Ed Sheeran,2017-03-03,"[Verse 1]
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

[Pre-Chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

[Bridge]
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real

Who been doing it my way, getting my way for years
In my career

In and out my life, I've hit, love and left the tears
Without a care

She caught me by surprise

Be careful who you do 'cause karma comes back around

That it wouldn't happen to me 'cause I know how to put it down
But I was so wrong

Living our lives trough a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence

Where nothing will ever be enough
Happily numb

Drink, this one's on me

Keep sweeping it under the mat

Christmas Wrapping,The Waitresses,1990-10-23,"""Bah, humbug"" no, that's too strong
Cause it is my favorite holiday
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy

To add to my already mad rush
Just cause it's 'tis the season
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from

Last year, ski shop
Encounter, most interesting
Had his number but never the time
Most of '81 passed along those lines

So deck those halls, trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath
Christmas by myself this year

Calendar picture, frozen landscape
Chilled this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens, sparkling snow
Get this winter over with

Flashback to springtime, saw him again
Would've been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch

Didn't, of course, 'til summertime
Out to the beach to his boat could I join him?
No, this time it was me
Sunburn in the third degree

Now the calendar's just one page
And, of course, I am excited
Tonight's the night, but I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it

Hardly dashing through the snow
Cause I bundled up too tight
Last minute have to do
A few cards a few calls

Cause it's ""RSVP""
No thanks, no party lights
It's Christmas eve, gonna relax
Turned down all of my invites

Last fall I had a night to myself
Same guy called, Halloween party
Waited all night for him to show
This time his car wouldn't go

Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late
Trudge on home to celebrate
In a quiet way, unwind
Doing Christmas right this time

A&P has provided me
With the world's smallest turkey
Already in the oven, nice and hot
Oh damn! Guess what I forgot?

So on, with the boots, back out in the snow
To the only all-night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year

""I'm spending this one alone,"" he said
""Need a break, this year's been crazy""
I said, ""Me too, but why are you?
You mean you forgot cranberries too?""

Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending

Fight fear for the selfish pain, it was worth it every time
Hold still right before we crash 'cause we both know how this ends
Our clock ticks 'til it breaks your glass and I drown in you again

[Chorus]
'Cause you are the piece of me I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly, still fight and I don't know why
If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?

If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?

[Verse 2]
Walk on through a red parade and refuse to make amends
It cuts deep through our ground and makes us forget all common sense
Don't speak as I try to leave 'cause we both know what we'll choose
If you pull, then I'll push too deep and I'll fall right back to you

[Chorus]
'Cause you are the piece of me I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly, still fight and I don't know why
If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?

I look and stare so deep in your eyes (I...)
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave, I'm begging you not to go
Call your name, two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling, and my pride is the one to blame (Yeah)
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
When I talk to my friends so quietly
(""Who he think he is?"") Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Jay-Z]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now

I sling though, if anything, I bling yo
A star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret
You crazy? Bring ya whole set
JAY-Z in the Range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure him out, they like, ""Hey, is he insane?"" (Oh, no)
Yes sir, I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur: chinchilla
I've been iller than chain smokers
How you think I got the name Hova?
I been realer, the game's over
Fall back, Young
Ever since I made the change over to platinum
The game's been a wrap, one

Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care
'Cause your love's got the best of me
And baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees

You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Hey baby

[Verse 1]
Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s popping right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, ""Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs""
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said

[Chorus]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Verse 2]
She was sipping on Southern and singing Marshall Tucker
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
""Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck""

So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Verse 3]
When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
Because it felt so right, her and I, man, we felt so right

[Verse 4]
I put it in park and grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl, you sure got the beat in my chest bumping
Hell, I can't get you out of my head

Baby, you a song

Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle

Something happened for the first time
Deep inside, it was a rush, what a rush
'Cause the possibility
That you would ever feel the same way about me
Just too much, just too much

Cause I've tried and tried to walk away
But I know this crush ain't going away-ay-ay
Going away-ay-ay

Something that will last, last forever, forever

A house, and everything in between

My power compels hell's demons to slam dance
And when I stage dive I burn all of my fans hands
My microphone is buried in the catacombs
Underneath Indiana Jones decomposed bones
Never fuck around I'm the thermo aerodynamic shuttle graph that crashed on a small foreign planet
4 billion years ago now humans hear my flow and hold their heads like their ears will blow
Arrows pierce my foe I'm fierce to those who oppose
We bring sharp darts spears and bows
Always on the low move slow like crouching ninjas
Plus the squad got more gods than mount olympus
Battle like were vicious sacrifice infants
And hack into the government with satellite positions
Evacuate your land like its Afghanistan
Cause our missile move faster than your fucking camels can

[Chorus]
Move, Bounce, come on fight
Wild the fuck out while we rock the mic
Bob your head to this track you don't stop for shit
Evil, 8 and apathy with the power to rip (motherfucker)
X2

[Evil]
My power
Devours flesh like acid showers
And makes whole troops roll out like after hours
Fuck y'all back off to hell with your squad
Im a god, watch the sun melt in my palm
My intelligence sours beyond yours its your highness
The white stallion rock the moon its my medallion
And the saturn rings is the link to the chain
Im on a higher level we just ain't thinking the same
I throw my dick into space and play pool with the planets
Knock shit out of orbit watch fools start to panic
Precise with the flow never rapping off beat
Even got more power than those cats on dragon ball z
What y'all know about me
Blasting galactic weapons
That would make the human race break out fast like adolescence
Ah black magic repping warlocks and witches
But still remain low-key like door locks for midgets

[Chorus]
Move, Bounce, come on fight
Wild the fuck out while we rock the mic
Bob your head to this track you don't stop for shit
Evil, 8 and apathy with the power to rip (motherfucker)
X2

[8th wonder]
My power
Attracts power magnetically
Evil apathetic and me surpass any degree
We snatch cheddar and flee
I laugh any mc claiming then raps stack pack metal better than we
Fuck that kids stuff i ain't taking that shit
Get your ass out of bed and stop making you sick
I skydive out plane on tour stage backwards
The vision to ill to stunt double reenact
So understand yo the level I'm at
I could spit phlegm and that would be a terrible act
And when i get on the track and fuck around is when i tell you
Cause if you get me mad I'LL TRANSFORM INTO THE DEVIL
Ill stop the beat freak it a cappella and scream
I'm too fucking dirty from black decka [?] to clean
Command it to go backwards
I'm damaging all rappers
I'm a martian that landed on the planet to cause havoc

[Chorus]
Move, Bounce, come on fight
Wild the fuck out while we rock the mic
Bob your head to this track you don't stop for shit
Evil, 8 and apathy with the power to rip (motherfucker)

Every Rose Has Its Thorn,Poison,1988-03-21,"[Verse 1]
We both lie silently still in the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together we feel miles apart inside
Was it something I said or something I did?
Did my words not come out right?
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried
But I guess that's why they say

[Chorus]
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Yeah it does

[Verse 2]
I listen to our favorite song playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say love's a game of easy come and easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow
I guess

[Chorus]
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad sad song
Every rose has its thorn

[Bridge]
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

[Verse 3]
I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways

[Verse 4]
And now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife
I guess

Just like every night has its dawn

Bills and Os and oh-yays
Dade County always, 305 all day
Now, baby, we can parlay or, baby, we can party
She read books, especially about red rooms and tie-ups (Yeah)
I got it hooked, ‘cause she seen me in a suit with the red tie tied up
Christian Gris, nice to meet ya
But time is money, only difference is I own it
Now let's stop time and enjoy this moment

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera & (Pitbull)]
One day when the light is glowin'
I’ll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment
Whoa-oh, (C'mon), I just wanna feel this moment
Whoa-oh, (C'mon), I just wanna feel this moment

Woo!
Come on, feel this moment!

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I see the future but live for the moment
Make sense, don't it? Hah
Now make dollars, I mean billions, yeah
I'm a genius, I mean brilliant (Brilliant)
This street is what schooled him (Schooled him)
And made him slicker than Slick Rick the Ruler (eah)
I've lost a lot and learned a lot
But I'm still undefeated like Shula
I'm far from cheap
I break down companies with all my peeps (That's right)
Baby, we can travel the world
And what I can give you is all you can see
Time is money, only difference is I own it
Like a stopwatch, let's stop time and enjoy this moment (Dalé)

Fireflies,Owl City,2009-01-01,"[Verse 1]
You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
The disco ball is just hanging by a thread

'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep (Haha)

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (Said farewell)
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre

Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards
One blow from caving in
Do you ever feel already buried deep
Six feet under scream
But no one seems to hear a thing

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow

Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you can open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

Come on show 'em what your worth
Make 'em go ""Oh, oh, oh!""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby you're a firework
Come on let your colors burst

Frosty The Snowman,Ella Fitzgerald,1960-01-01,"Frosty the snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman
Is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know

How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head

He began to dance around
Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say

He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day

So he said let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away
Down to the village

With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town

Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop
Frosty the snowman

Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying don't you cry
I'll be back again some day

Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at frosty go

Thumpety thump thump

Galway Girl,Ed Sheeran,2017-03-03,"[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand

[Verse 3]
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

I wish somebody would have told me, babe
Someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I was thinkin' 'bout the band
I was thinkin' 'bout the fans
We were underground
Loadin' merch in that 12-passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at
Still growin' up, still growin' up
I would lay in my bed and dream about what I'd become
Couldn't wait to get older, couldn't wait to be some
Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
Those good old days

I wish somebody would have told me, babe

And all these reckless nights you won't regret

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Wish I didn't think I had the answers
Wish I didn't drink all of that flask first
Wish I made it to homecoming
Got up the courage to ask her
Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
And felt comfortable in myself
Rooftop open, and the stars above
Moment frozen, sneakin' out, and fallin' in love
Me, you and that futon, we'd just begun
On the grass dreamin', figuring out who I was
Those good old days

I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days

Never thought we'd get old, maybe we're still young
Maybe you always look back and think it was better than it was
Maybe these are the moments
Maybe I've been missin' what it's about
Been scared of the future, thinkin' about the past
While missin' out on now
We've come so far, I guess I'm proud
And I ain't worried 'bout the wrinkles 'round my smile

I've felt some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now

Gotta Be Somebody,Nickelback,2008-10-28,"[Verse 1]
This time, I wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life
The one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing
I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath
Right up 'til the end
Until that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with

[Chorus]
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own)
And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone)
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere)
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight
And dammit, this feels too right
It's just like déja vu, me standing here with you

Could this be the end?

I find the one that I'll spend forever with?

Paint my nails and wear perfume for you
Make me so nervous that I just can’t hold your hand

[Chorus]
You make me glow
But I cover up, won’t let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don’t wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I’d have a heart attack
I think I’d have a heart attack
I think I’d have a heart attack

[Bridge]
The feelings are lost in my lungs
They’re burning, I’d rather be numb
And there’s no one else to blame
So scared, I’ll take off in a run
I’m flying too close to the sun and I’ll burst into flames

[Chorus]
You make me glow
But I cover up, won’t let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don’t wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I’d have a heart attack
I think I’d have a heart attack (Heart attack)

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 1]
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend – well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we wasn't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 a.m. on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me fo'?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
‘Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

In the night, I hear 'em talk (Me)
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got somethin' new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight into the night

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road

*******[PLAY SONG ""FLIGHT OF THE NAVIGATOR"" AT THIS POINT]*******

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

[VISUAL]

The Boy wakes up. He's in a gown. His eyes feel heavy. The TV is on in his room. ""Golden Girls"" to be specific. One of the ladies just said something funny cause there's a lot of laughter

Sitcom laughs always freaked him out. Because most of those people are dead. Those are ghost laughs. Laughs that are supposed to be gone forever linger on earth after every mid 90s joke about teenage sex or someone saying ""don't go there"". Looking for their mouths, never finding them because they're gone. The laughs don't feel good because they're dead laughs. Those laughs aren't what they stood for anymore. They've been reappropriated. Now they're just sounds monkey descendants make when amused to cue other monkey descendants when to make the sounds at home

...my eyes feel heavy

A nurse comes in

       WHITE GUY NURSE: Hello Mr.[EDIT]. How are you feeling?
       THE BOY: Like I'm about to get talked to by someone about- (gestures) All this

Nurse gives a ""yep"" look

       WHITE GUY NURSE: You're friends brought you in-
       THE BOY: They're not my friends
       WHITE GUY NURSE: I don't think they'd like you saying that
       THE BOY: Doesn't matter. It's the truth. But also, they know. We're not friends. There's a mutual benefit to our relationship, but I can't trust them for shit
       WHITE GUY NURSE: Then why save you?
       THE BOY: Cause their lives are far easier with me around. It's survival
       WHITE GUY NURSE: I think you should talk to someone
       THE BOY: We're talking
       WHITE GUY NURSE: A professional
       THE BOY: Why? You don't care. You're not gonna make sure I do. (then) Our lives aren't precious, man

Silence. The Nurse begins to clean up

       WHITE GUY NURSE: You done?
       THE BOY: I was trying to be
       WHITE GUY NURSE: No you weren't. Cause, guess what? It's not hard to do

Nurse leaves

INT. WAITING ROOM - LATER THAT DAY
The Boy walks out of the double doors. Steve, Swank, and Fam are sitting there. They look up wearily

       THE BOY: I don't wanna talk. Let's just go be awkward and quiet together at Chipotle. Alright?

They all just stare. Swank gets up slowly and walks over

       SWANK: Man...we didn't know if we should wait or tell you later, man

The Boy makes a [""WHAT?"" EMOJI] face

       SWANK (CONT'D): Man...your pops died, man. Got the call

Silence

       THE BOY: Okay

(hum of a jet engine...)

*******[PLAY SONG ""ZEALOTS OF STOCKHOLM"" AT THIS POINT]*******

INT. JET PLANE - EVENING
The Boy lays his head against the plane window, the oil from his hair leaving grease smudges all over the window
His father died in Stockholm. A family member was needed. Didn't realize that they were each other's only family til this very moment. When you lose that, you basically lose most of your memories, at least the accuracy of your own memories
He wanted to be cremated
The Boy didn't really know anyone in Stockholm, but he also didn't want to be in his hotel room with his father for a day. Even if he was just ashes. So he decided to search through his followers for someone from Sweden

Some girl named ""Hello_Pity_"" Dm'd him back and they were supposed to meet up after all the whatever he had to do. Her profile bio said she was half french. She looked pretty in her avi: an inverted Hello Kitty. But that really doesn't mean anything at all, especially since her instagram was blocked, which is something he's learned not to trust at all
So he looked through her tweets, figured out a night she went to a club, used one of his dummy profiles and pretended that they'd met at the club that night. She had trouble remembering because, according to her feed, she was ""fuckin turnt, [CRAZY TONGUE OUT EMOJI] lol"". She added this made up dude as a friend on Facebook. Now The Boy could see her pictures
The rest of her pictures confirmed she was indeed pretty
This girl loves Justin Bieber though. New Justin Bieber. The ""fuck you"" Bieber. She loves Justin Bieber in the way you love that girl on Maury who's like ""my favorite flavor popsicle is DICK!"", which is close to sincere love, but nowhere near it at the same time

INT. STRANGE OFFICE - NIGHT
The Boy is sitting at a desk, across from a solemn man. An urn sits on the left side of the desk
The man slides it over to The Boy

       SOLEMN MAN: I'm sorry for your loss

Silence. Don't you have to ask someone before you cremate their father? I don't know how these things work

       SOLEMN MAN (CONT'D): These were found with him

He gives The Boy a large brown paper bag

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
The Boy vapes on the foot of his bed. He's DMing back and forth with ""Hello_Pity_"" whose real name is Alyssa

       thegoldmolar: where u at
       Hello_Pity_: bar called box. meet u here?
       thegoldmolar: yeah
       Hello_Pity_: u should meet my boyfriend. he loves you

Weird

       thegoldmolar: sure
       Hello_Pity_: [CRYING LAUGH EMOJI] LOL. Don't worry. It's not like that
       thegoldmolar: wdym
       Hello_Pity_: [CRAZY TONGUE OUT EMOJI] see u soon

He puts his phone down

EXT. STOCKHOLM STREETS - NIGHT
There's a buzz going on. Very pretty people walk hand in hand on the street. There are people saying things, giving opinions, feeling interesting. Everyone has a purpose tonight. It's a great time
A couple walk by:

       SUPER HANDSOME GUY: Swedish blah blah blah roscoe's wetsuit hahahaha!
       SUPER PRETTY GIRL: blah blah, swedish blah blah roscoe's wetsuit!

The Boy walks up to a pink, glowing, but very discreet sign that says ""box"". There's a big bald guy standing outside with no hat. There's steam coming off his head
A girl is standing outside smoking, at least trying to. She can't seem to get the cigarette lit. It's Alyssa

       THE BOY: Hey
       ALYSSA: Ah! It's you

She gives him a kiss on both cheeks

       ALYSSA (CONT'D): Fancy meeting you like this, huh?
       THE BOY: I don't know what you mean

She puts out her cigarette. After two big puffs

       ALYSSA: Let's go
       THE BOY: Didn't you want me to meet your boyfriend?
       ALYSSA: Who? That guy?

She points to a corner of the building, a few steps from the front. A guy with long blonde hair (her boyfriend?)is making out with a girl in the cold

       THE BOY: What am I getting into?
       ALYSSA: Nothing. You're getting into nothing

CUT TO:
EXT. STOCKHOLM STREETS - CONTINUOUS
The Boy and Alyssa walk slowly through the streets. It's very cold, so they're the only ones doing that

       ALYSSA: What made you DM me?
       THE BOY: I don't know anyone here
       ALYSSA: Then why are you here?
       THE BOY: My dad died. I have to pick him up
       ALYSSA: R O U G H. How?
       THE BOY: Doesn't matter at this point
       ALYSSA: I know right? It's always ""how'd he die?"" Like if you know all the ways, you'll avoid it. Silly

She shivers

       ALYSSA (CONT'D): I don't believe in small talk. What's the longest relationship you've been in?
       THE BOY: Five years
       ALYSSA: Wow. What happened?
       THE BOY: I'm still in it
       ALYSSA: Oh?
       THE BOY: She does private web shows. We're not together. But it's a relationship, for sure
       ALYSSA: I don't get it
       THE BOY: I used to watch her online a while back. Then she quit and started doing private shows. Then it just started turning into talking. Mostly
       ALYSSA: Wooooaah
       THE BOY: Wha?
       ALYSSA: You're paying her to be your girlfriend or friend or whatever
       THE BOY: Yes. But most people are paying for friends one way or another
       ALYSSA: No
       THE BOY: Your boyfriend is making out with another girl right now. You don't really have room to judge
       ALYSSA: I trust that I can never trust him. We're clear on that
       THE BOY: Then why have him at all?
       ALYSSA: Because he's honest. And I like that. He doesn't lie to either of us. That's special to me

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

[VISUAL]
The two are sitting on the bed staring at the urn on the table

       ALYSSA: So that's your dad
       THE BOY: That's my dad. That's what's left of him
       ALYSSA: You guys close?
       THE BOY: No
       ALYSSA: You wanna talk about it
       THE BOY: No

Silence

       THE BOY (CONT'D): I'm going to make a drink
       ALYSSA: Alright

The Boy gets up and goes into the living room. While he's in there, Alyssa gets up, takes the urn, and walks out of the room. The Boy hears the door slam

       THE BOY: Alyssa?

CUT TO:

*******[PLAY SONG ""URN"" AT THIS POINT]*******

EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT
The Boy runs out of the front doors. His breath, clouding in the night. He looks both ways and catches Alyssa turning a corner. He runs to the corner and meets her on the other side

       THE BOY: What's going on
       ALYSSA: Let's get rid of it. It's just bad for you
       THE BOY: You have a TON of nerve judging me and my father's relationship, so much so, you just walk out with his ashes? I feel like what you're doing is against the law, but much like the fact he was cremated before I arrived, I don't know if it's illegal. I'm still pissed though
       ALYSSA: We're gonna do this together

The Boy is pissed. He's trying not to blow up

       ALYSSA (CONT'D): I had a sister. I did this when she died
       THE BOY: Yes. That gives you the right

Alyssa digs in her pocket and pulls out her phone. She turns it on and the background is Alyssa and a girl that looks exactly like her. The Boy takes the phone

       THE BOY (CONT'D): Twins
       ALYSSA: Yes
       THE BOY: I know we agreed that it's dumb to ask since we're all headed that way anyway, but-
       ALYSSA: Brain cancer. It was bad

Silence

       ALYSSA (CONT'D): So crazy

She LOLs. They're still walking this entire time. They stop at the water. They stand there making small clouds for a moment

       ALYSSA (CONT'D): You want to say something?

The Boy shrugs

       ALYSSA (CONT'D): Alright-
       THE BOY: Wait

The urn almost tips over the edge. She waits for him. He walks over and takes the urn and just holds it for a moment. Then he kinda hugs it. Laying his head on it, but turning his head so she can't see what he says:

       THE BOY (CONT'D, whisper): I'm sorry we're alone

[VISUAL]

He pours out the ashes. He's gone

       ALYSSA: How do you feel? Better?
       THE BOY: I feel...the same
       VOICE: HEY!

Alyssa and The Boy turn around. It's Alyssa's boyfriend

       BOYFRIEND: What the fuck, bro?
       ALYSSA: Oh, so you now you give a fuck

She pushes him back as he takes swipes at The Boy. The Boy is mildly annoyed. They're all yelling at each other

       BOYFRIEND/THE BOY/ALYSSA: You're dead ass-hole!/ Relax, nothing happened/ Would you stop!

The boyfriend breaks free from her

       BOYFRIEND: Do you know who the fuck I am?

       ALYSSA: Please don't. Please don't do this
       THE BOY: Nah, man. I don't know who you are
       BOYFRIEND (CONT'D, scream): WHAT DOES THE FOX SAY! (silence) I. Wrote. That. That's my shit. I'm the nigga dressed like a fox. That's all me
       THE BOY: What?

The boyfriend starts making the noises a fox makes in the song

       BOYFRIEND: That!
       ALYSSA (resigned, to The Boy): Like the song and video
       THE BOY: I've never heard of it
       ALYSSA AND BOYFIREND: What/wha?
       ALYSSA: I thought you ""were the internet""?
       THE BOY: That's a tagline. No one is the actual internet. I just must've missed it when it was popular
       BOYFRIEND: Uh, by ""when it was popular"" do you mean, uhhh, RIGHT THE FUCK NOW?!
       THE BOY: Relax
       BOYFRIEND: Two hundred and twenty million views on Youtube. Two hundred and twenty million. That's most of the earth
       THE BOY: Not true
       BOYFRIEND: An African village wrote to me-
       THE BOY: The whole village did?
       BOYFRIEND: -and told me that my song taught them about foxes. They don't have foxes there. I introduced the idea of a fox to an entire continent...(then) And you wanna fuck my girl?

Silence

       THE BOY: I do not wanna fuck your girl. I don't want to be here. I am going home now

The Boy walks away. Alyssa and her boyfriend start a boring argument in the cold as he disappears

CUT TO:
INT. LA VEGAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Fam, another girl, and The Boy sit in a booth at the restaurant. Fam and the girl are talking. The Boy is silent. Don't know if he's just bored or jet lagged from Sweden. Either way he's bumming everyone out

       ANOTHER GIRL: My friend should be here soon

The Boy doesn't say anything. Fam and the girl look on
A girl walks up to the table. The Boy looks up. It's the girl from the party

       NAOMI: Hi

The Boy doesn't say anything

       ANOTHER GIRL: This is Naomi. (then) Hello?
       FAM: He's dumb. You should just sit and ignore him

She sits down

       NAOMI: You're the guy that almost hit my arm
       THE BOY: Yes
       NAOMI: You guys order?
       THE BOY: No. I hate vegan. I think she's making us eat here
       NAOMI: I'm the vegan. I asked to eat here

Silence

       THE BOY: I hate vegan
       NAOMI (saying it dumb): Duhh, ""I hate vegan""

In his head, he was lol-ing. In real life, he just kinda looked down

       NAOMI (CONT'D): What's the deal. Why you always act like your parents died

The Boy smirks

       THE BOY: They did

Awkward. Silence

       ANOTHER GIRL: I'm so sorry

Fam and The Boy stare at each other for a moment. Then laugh. Another Girl and Naomi do not

       FAM (to The Boy): Your parents are dead, man
       THE BOY: My parents are dead yo

They slowly stop laughing. Naomi thinks The Boy is weird. But she doesn't run

INT. MANSION - NIGHT
Fam and Another Girl are sitting on the swings smoking and talking about something they will never remember and don't really care about
Naomi and The Boy sit in the living room

       NAOMI: What did he do?
       THE BOY: I don't know
       NAOMI: How'd he afford all this?
       THE BOY: I don't know
       NAOMI: Then how can you afford all this? He leave you a lot?
       THE BOY: Creditors were after him. I don't know if he had anything left. I'm not concerned. (serious) I'm gonna sell drugs

Naomi LMAOs

       NAOMI: Whaaaaaat
       THE BOY: Fam can hook me up. I've been watching him for a minute. He runs out of here already
       NAOMI: I don't think you need me to tell you you're an awful dealer
       THE BOY: How would you even know?
       NAOMI: You make everything feel awkward. You can't connect with anyone. How is anyone supposed to feel like they can trust you?
       THE BOY: Yeah, that's what drug dealers are known for. Their comfort
       NAOMI: They are, dumb-ass. You gotta know how people work. You're only good with people online

He slowly turns to her. ""how does she know that?""

       NAOMI (CONT'D): I looked you up
       THE BOY: After the party or just now
       NAOMI: Just now. I'm a writer too
       THE BOY: Oh really
       NAOMI: Yup. And I know I'm good cause people keep stealing my shit

She hits the vape

       NAOMI (CONT'D): I tweeted this. (holds up her phone) Is that not my poem verbatim? I posted them together. This nigga just rapped this like it was his
       THE BOY (looking at her phone): Your first mistake is being a poet past the year 1974, by the way
       NAOMI: That's how good my shit is. I'm bringing the whole form back
       THE BOY: You're cocky when you're high
       NAOMI: No. I'm talkative when I'm high. I'm cocky all the time, but I'm silent for most of it...like you

He looks up. She lifts an eyebrow. He doesn't smile. She goes cross-eyed. No response. She stops, then sighs

       NAOMI (CONT'D): You ever think we're in hell? This is all hell. Living on earth and being the only ones aware that it's all ending slowly

Silence

       THE BOY: No
       NAOMI: I read something that said more than likely we all just do this all again. It's all a cycle
       THE BOY: I like that theory
       NAOMI: Yeah. (then) See? You're not such a lonely boy

She LOLs and mushes his face with her hand. The Boy smh, but smiles

A hundred days have made me older
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
A thousand lies have made me colder

How To Save A Life,The Fray,2005-09-13,"[Verse 1]
Step one, you say we need to talk
He walks, you say sit down; it's just a talk
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God He hears you
And pray to God He hears you, and

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness

You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Eyes shut still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and surviors
Norway no you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a Coward
Face just showered, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Lil mama got me feeling like a lemon-head
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
Give 'em my regards or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Gettin' mad cause the quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not impressive
Oh no I can't stop, I was destined

And right now radio's all that we can hear
Now we ain't talked since we left, it's so overdue
It's cold outside, but between us, it's worse in here

The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts

Slipping through our fingers
I don't wanna try now

Jesus Take The Wheel,Carrie Underwood,2005-11-14,"[Verse 1]
She was driving last Friday on the way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it, she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

[Chorus]
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

[Verse 2]
It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight""

[Chorus]
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Oh, Jesus, take the wheel

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

Let It Go,Pentatonix,2015-10-30,"The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation, and it looks like I'm the Queen
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, Heaven knows I've tried

Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well now they know

Let it go, let it go
Can't hold me back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway

It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all

It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free!

Let it go, let it go
I walk with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand
And here I'll stay
Let the storm rage on

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past

Let it go, let it go
When I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand
In the light of day

It's kinda hard to talk right now

Hearing those words it makes me weak
And I never want to say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful

And yes, I dreamt of you too
Does he know your talking to me
Will it start a fight

Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play

I don't like your perfect crime

You said the fun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)

They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)

And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

[Chorus 3]
And said: ""Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say 'yes'""

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2]
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring

I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here, and I'm happy that you did

I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

I'd spent the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish, to swim away with the fish
Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long

I'd be here writing this song

Miss guarded heart
Miss play it smart
Miss if you wanna use that line, you better not start, no

She went in a new direction
And found inside, she felt a connection

Monster Mash,Andrew Gold,1996-01-01,"I was working in the lab late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

He did the mash, he did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash
He did the mash, he did the monster mash

From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

They did the mash, they did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
They did the mash, it caught on in a flash
They did the mash, they did the monster mash

The zombies were having fun
The party had just begun
The guests included Wolf Man
Dracula and his son

The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group, ""The Crypt-Kicker Five""

They played the mash, they played the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
They played the mash, it caught on in a flash
They played the mash, they played the monster mash

Out from his coffin, Drac's voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist
And said, ""Whatever happened to my Transylvania twist?""

It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash
The monster mash and it's a graveyard smash
It's now the mash, it's caught on in a flash
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash

Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band
And my monster mash is the hit of the land
For you, the living, this mash was meant too
When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you

Then you can mash, then you can monster mash
The monster mash and do my graveyard smash

You hear at night?
And every other night for the rest of the nights
That there are
Every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me
'Cause I know that's a good place to start

I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife
While you bleeding
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won't stop until you believe it
'Cause baby you're worth it

So don't act like it's a bad thing
To fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around
And find your dreams come true, with me
Spend all your time and your money

To fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing
To fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
No such a bad thing to fall in love

No I won't fill your mind, broken promises
And waste of time
And if you fall
You'll always land right in these arms
These arms of mine

So don't act like it's a bad thing
To fall in love with me
'Cause you might f*ck around

One Week,Barenaked Ladies,1998-07-07,"[Verse 1]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side and said, ""I'm angry""
Five days since you laughed at me, saying
""Get that together, come back and see me""
Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry

[Verse 2: Ed Robertson]
Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
As I make you stop, think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes
Big like LeAnn Rimes, because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinking aching shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavours
Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know
The vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous, you'll have to sign a waiver

[Chorus]
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt

[Verse 3]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air and said, ""You're crazy""
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees
It's been three days since the afternoon
You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry

[Verse 4: Ed Robertson]
Chickity China, the Chinese chicken
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'
Watching X-Files with no lights on
We're dans la maison
I hope the Smoking Man's in this one
Like Harrison Ford, I'm getting frantic
Like Sting, I'm tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy
Like Kurosawa, I make mad films, 'kay, I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a Samurai
Gonna get a set of better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon
'Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes
That make me think the wrong thing

How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad

I have a history of losing my shirt

[Verse 5]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Dropped your arms to the sides and said, ""I'm sorry""
Five days since I laughed at you and said
""You just did just what I thought you were gonna do""
Three days since the living room
We realized we're both to blame but what could we do?
Yesterday, you just smiled at me
'Cause it'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry

Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous

You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos

Where are the plans we made for two?

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be...
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me

You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights

Still stuck in that time
When we called it love

'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away

Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

And the walls kept tumbling down
In the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills
Bringing darkness from above

But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like
Nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like
You've been here before?

How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

Well, you almost had me fooled
Told me that I was nothing without you
Oh, but after everything you've done
I can thank you for how strong I have become

’Cause you brought the flames and you put me through hell
I had to learn how to fight for myself
And we both know all the truth I could tell

I hope you find your peace

No more monsters, I can breathe again
And you said that I was done
Well, you were wrong and now the best is yet to come

Okay, Coconut Man, Moonhead and Pea
You ready?

Seems like everybody's got a price
I wonder how they sleep at night
When the sale comes first and the truth comes second
Just stop for a minute and smile
Why is everybody so serious?
Acting so damn mysterious
Got shades on your eyes
And your heels so high that you can't even have a good time

Everybody look to their left
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel that?
Yeah, we're paying with love tonight

We need to take it back in time
When music made us all unite
And it wasn't low blows and video hoes
Am I the only one getting tired?

Money can't buy us happiness
Can we all slow down and enjoy right now?
Guarantee we'll be feeling alright

Just give me six strings and a half stack
And you can keep the cars, leave me the garage
And all I, yes, all I need are keys and guitars
And it's within' 30 seconds, I'm leaving to Mars
Yeah, we leaping across these undefeatable odds
It's like this man, you can't put a price on a life
We do this for the love, so we fight and sacrifice every night

Put Your Records On,The Chipettes,2009-12-01,"Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

Maybe sometimes
We got it wrong but it's alright
The more things seem to change
The more they stay the same
Oh, don't you hesitate

Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down

Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere
Somehow

Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in the bar by the roadside
Just relax, just relax
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Gotta love that afro hairdo

Maybe sometimes
We feel afraid, but it's alright
The more you stay the same
The more they seem to change
Oh, don't you think it's strange?

Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down

I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere

Pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake
I thought that I was stronger

That you don't even have to
Try any longer?
Do what you want to?

Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever

Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare

Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
Take away your things and go
You can't take back what you said, I know
I've heard it all before, at least a million times
I'm not one to forget, you know

[Pre-Chorus 1: Selena Gomez]
I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe
I'm on my knees right now

[Chorus: Selena Gomez with Charli XCX]
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
Cause I won't be changing too, you know

You can't believe, still can't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces

Say Hey (I Love You),Michael Franti & Spearhead,2008-01-01,"[Intro]
This one goes out to you and yours, worldwide

[Chorus]
I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you

[Verse 1]
I've been a lot of places all around the way
I've seen a lot of joy and I've seen a lot of pain
But I don't want to write a love song for the world
I just want to write a song about a boy and a girl

Junkies on the corner always calling my name
And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games
When I saw you getting down, well, I hope it was you
And when I look into your eyes I knew it was true

[Chorus]
I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you

[Verse 2]
Now I'm not a highly metaphysical man
But I know when the stars are aligned you can
Bump into a person in the middle of the road
Look into their eyes and you suddenly know

Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
Dancing in the night in the middle of June
My momma told me don't lose you
'Cause the best luck I had was you

[Chorus]
I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you

Say You Won't Let Go,James Arthur,2016-10-28,"[Verse 1]
I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

[Chorus 1]
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool
When I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed

I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Verse 2]
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

[Chorus 2]
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more
Than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go

Without falling to your feet

And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face

I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here, forever

My friend the communist
Holds meetings in his RV
I can't afford his gas

I don't have diddly squat

It's wanting what you've got

To lighten up
I'm gonna tell 'em that
I've got no one to blame
For every time I feel lame
I'm looking up
I'm gonna soak up the sun
I'm gonna soak up the sun

I've got a crummy job
It don't pay near enough
To buy the things it takes
To win me some of your love

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time I turn around
I'm looking up, you're looking down
Maybe something's wrong with you
That makes you act the way you do
Maybe I am crazy too

Gonna tell everyone
To lighten up
I'm gonna tell 'em that
I've got no one to blame

While it's still free
I'm gonna soak up the sun
Before it goes out on me

Don't have no master suite
But I'm still the king of me
You have a fancy ride, but baby

I work from nine to five, hey hell I pay the price

And I have no privacy
I always feel that somebody's watchin' me
Is it just a dream?
When I come home at night
I bolt the door real tight

And I have no privacy
I always feel that somebody's watchin' me

Somebody That I Used To Know,Mayday Parade,2012-11-06,"[Verse 1]
Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

[Verse 2]
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

[Chorus]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

[Refrain: Vic Fuentes]
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

[Verse 3: Vic Fuentes]
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

What do I stand for?

Why don't we break the rules already?

Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes, it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots and when I see you, it gets so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me (Uh-huh), you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight
I melt with you, you got me head over heels (Over heels)
Boy, you keep me hangin' on, the way you make me feel

Boy, you know you got me feelin' open
And boy, your love's enough with words unspoken
I said boy, I'm tellin' you, you got me open
I don't know what to do, it's true
I'm goin' crazy over you, I'm beggin'

I was lying on the grass
On Sunday morning of last week
Indulging in my self-defeat
My mind was thugged, all laced and bugged
All twisted wrong and beat
A comfortable in three feet deep
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there
On a confusing morning week
Impaired my tribal lunar speak
And of course you can't become if you only say
What you would have done
So I missed a million miles of fun

I know it's up for me

Making sure I'm not in too deep

Keeping versed and on my feet

I was lying on the bench slide
In the park across the street
L-A-T-E-R that week
My sticky paws were in to making straws
Out of big fat Slurpee treats
An incredible eight foot heap
Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tare
In a staring under heat
Involved an under usual feat
And I'm not only among
But I invite who I want to come
So I missed a million miles of fun

It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

But now I'm insecure, an' I care what people think

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick

For the summer, for the summer
I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone since that summer, since that summer

Hip hop, marmalade, spick-and-span
Met you one summer and it all began
You're the best girl that I ever did see
The great Larry Bird, Jersey 33
When you take a sip, you buzz like a hornet
Billy Shakespeare wrote a whole bunch of sonnets
Call me Willy Whistle 'cause I can't speak, baby
Somethin' in your eyes really drove me crazy
Now I can't forget you and it makes me mad
Left one day and never came back
Stayed all summer, then went back home
Macaulay Culkin was in Home Alone
Fell deep in love, but now we ain't speakin'
Michael J. Fox was Alex P. Keaton
When I met you, I said my name is Rich
You look like a girl from Abercrombie & Fitch

Always been hip to the B-boy style
Known to act wild and make a girl smile
Love New Edition and the Candy Girl
Reminds me of you 'cause you rock my world
You come from Georgia, where the peaches grow
They drink lemonade and speak real slow
You love hip hop and rock and roll
Dad took off when you were four years old
There was a good man named Paul Revere
I feel much better, baby, when you're near
You love Fun Dip and Cherry Coke
I like the way you laugh when I tell a joke
When I met you, I said my name was Rich
You looked like a girl from Abercrombie & Fitch

Shake and wiggle to a hip hop song
Summertime girls are the kind I like
I'll steal your honey, like I stole your bike
Boogaloo Shrimp and pogo sticks
My mind takes me back there oh so quick
Let you off the hook, like my man Mr. Limpet
Think about that summer and I bug 'cause I miss it
I like The Color Purple, macaroni and cheese
Ruby red slippers and a bunch of trees
Call you up, but what's the use?
I like Kevin Bacon, but I hate Footloose
Came in the door, I said it before
I think I'm over you, but I'm really not sure
When I met you, I said my name was Rich
You looked like a girl From Abercrombie & Fitch

[Hook]
New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer
I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone since that summer, since that summer

[Bridge]
Summer girls come and summer girls go
Some are worthwhile, and some are s- so
Summer girls come and summer girls go
Some are worthwhile, and some are so so
Summertime girls got it goin' on
Shake and wiggle to a hip hop song
Summertime girls are the kind I like
I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike

[Hook]
New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer

Summertime Sadness,Madilyn Bailey,2013-09-13,"Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

I got my red dress on tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feeling alive

Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness

I've got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruising down the coast goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh oh oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, uh, a fresh cool young Lu
Trying to catch his microphone, check 2-1-2
Wanna believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees, what have you brung you?
Did you improve on the design, did you do something new?
Well your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You, the more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too
And then it hit me, standing outside of Heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me, I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung ""Blue""
Go back, whatever you did you undo
Heavy as heaven, the devil on me, two tons too

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down to the basement, past the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid
Then out through China, nearly miss the airliners
Magnified times five, unless it's pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze
Now that's important to say
Cause even with all that most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid
Meaning we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called and he told him to wait
Unstrap him from the chair and put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gonna clap and they ain't gonna praise
They want everything back that they've paid
Cause they've been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
So chauffeur, chauffeur, come and take me away
Cause I've been standing in this line for like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front, they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say ""You need to go and see that""
And everybody claps cause everybody is pleased
And then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like, ""Ha ha ha-ha-ha
Ha ha ha-ha-ha, ha""

Can't he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Bridge]
So I drive home alone, as I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Outro]
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

And make peace with an empty town

It's so good to be by your side, but we'll cry

And we'll feel so alive

Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all

You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact

The Only Exception,Jai Waetford,2013-12-06,"When I was younger I saw
My daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my momma swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

But, darling, you are the only exception
Well, you are the only exception
Well, you are the only exception
Well, you are the only exception

Maybe I know somewhere
Deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm content with loneliness

But, darling, you are the only exception
Well, you are the only exception
Well, you are the only exception
Well, you are the only exception
Well, you are the only exception

I've got a tight grip on reality, but I can't
Let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, whoa

You are the only exception
You are the only exception

I used to think one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met, and the sparks flew instantly

'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on

Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, I don't know what to say

And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy

Of how I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me

Thriller,Michael Jackson,2017-09-27,"[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking from the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus 1: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah, ooh

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

[Chorus 2: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with 40 eyes, girl
(Ooh, ooh)
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
They're open wide
This is the end of your life, ooh

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson]
They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side, ooh
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

[Chorus 3: Michael Jackson]
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
(Ooh, ooh)
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller
I'm gonna thrill you tonight

[Outro: Vincent Price & Michael Jackson]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller, ooh, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller night, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Ooh, babe, I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller night, babe
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40 thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist

Pulling up to the parties
Trying to get a little bit tipsy

Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in

Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

Yo, I ain't seen you in a minute
But I got something to tell you
Listen

[Verse 1]
See, the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kind of hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down, this may take a while
See this girl, she sort of looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you

[Chorus]
You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

[Verse 2]
Thought that she was the one for me
Til I found out she was on her creep
Ooh, she was sexing everyone, but me
This is why we could never be

[Chorus]
You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

I know it's so unfair to you (it's so unfair)
That I relate her ignorance to you
Wish I knew
Wish I knew how to separate the two
You remind me (you remind me)

Whoa whoa oh oh oh oh
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through

You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (all the shit she put me through)

Been a long time since you called me
(How could you forget about me?)
You gotta be feeling crazy
How can you walk away? Everything stays the same
I just can't do it, baby
What will it take to make you come back?

Why can't you look at me? You're still in love with me
Don't leave me crying

Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

[Chorus]
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

[Verse 2]
Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
But when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Because when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want

[Chorus]
That's why we're waiting

I remember when we broke up, the first time
Saying this is it I've had enough
Because like we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space, what?
Then you come around again and say
Baby I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change
Trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you

You called it off again last night

I'm telling you

But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

And me falling for a screaming that I'm right
And you hide away
And find your piece of mind with some indie record
That's much cooler than mine

Do you ever feel like breaking down?
Do you ever feel out of place
Like somehow you just don't belong
And no one understands you?
Do you ever wanna run away?
Do you lock yourself in your room
With the radio on turned up so loud
That no one hears your screaming?

No, you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels alright
You don't know what it's like
To be like me

To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around

And no one's there to save you

[Verse 2]
Do you wanna be somebody else?
Are you sick of feeling so left out?
Are you desperate to find something more
Before your life is over?
Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
Are you sick of everyone around?
With their big fake smiles and stupid lies
While deep inside you're bleeding

[Pre-Chorus]
No, you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels alright
You don't know what it's like
To be like me

And no one ever stabbed you in the back

And it's true
In this life
I've never been the one
In your eyes
I've never been the truth
All you saw
Was a broken mirror


[Verse 1]

We ain't kin of the land to them
We're black folk

Refugees on a raft
Just trying to stay afloat

I'm trying to enter my mode
Emotions out of control

How can I sit still
They want to put me in a mold

Just because I have a dream
They say that rap is a joke

Well I hate all these motherf***
I hope that they all choke

In this life that I'm living
I ain't never seen a GOAT

In this life that were living
Man we all just gotta grow

But I'm turning into something
That I've never seen before

Looking in a broken mirror
Picking pieces off the floor

See my idols in my iris
Tears falling over my eyelids

Will I make it to their level
I don't really f*** know


Gone off a bean
Young boy wilding
Never planned to be a fiend

Young boy breaking down
Same boy starts to scream

Stuck in a trance
Trying to wake from his dream

People starting at me
Like they ain't understanding my silence

If all lives matter
You ain't understanding the violence

We're victimized by police
And that's why we run from the sirens

They're in the streets to protect
But it seems like they do the opposite


I'm positive
People are just prone to popping sh**
Off of the mouth and sh**

Their just actors running plays
No Greg Popavich

It's propaganda
And they're gassed as Auschwitz
To profit from it

I've never been the one
In your eyes
I've never been the truth
All you saw

[Vesre 2]
I ain't never ran from a nigga
And I damn sure ain't bout to pick
Today to start running

I ain't never gang bang
But I might start gunning

Hit you dead on arrival
If you f*** up the money

If you f*** up progression
I could end it in a session

Lyricism leave you breathless
But the tech will leave you chestless

Young nigga reckless
Blow out your necklace
F*** your new b***
And then steal your Lexus


That's how I'd rap if I
Didn't prefer the realness

That's how I'd rap if I wasn't here
For the children

That's how I'd spit if I was
Just in it for millions

I don't want to be ill yet
I ain't tryna be brilliant

I just wanna be real and
Get listeners to feel this

What Ever I'm feeling

Cop beats and drill them

Pray God I heal some

Pray God I heal myself
In the process

Obsessed with objects
Of past

A new mind of glass
Freshly failed class
Will the memories last

Will the memories pass
Or will they stay etched in mind

Will I soon fade away
Or will I stay etched in time

And will there come a time
When I find the spine
To lay it all on the line
For the will to shine

The will to grind

Will I find the will to live
Or live to die

Either way I've
Cast the die

I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don’t bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out

There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay
But that’s not what gets me

Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away

It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ It
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still harder
Gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin’ with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

When You're Gone,Avril Lavigne,2007-04-17,"[Verse 1]
I always needed time on my own
I never thought I'd need you there when I cry
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie is made up on your side

[Pre-Chorus]
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

[Chorus]
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you

[Verse 2]
I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do, reminds me of you
And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
And they smell just like you
I love the things that you do

[Pre-Chorus]
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

And when you're gone
And the words I need to hear

And make it okay
I miss you

We were made for each other
Out here forever
I know we were, yeah, yeah
All I ever wanted was for you to know
Everything I do, I give my heart and soul
I can hardly breathe, I need to feel you here with me, yeah

Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
She said, ""Some days, I feel like shit
Some days, I wanna quit and just be normal for a bit""
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along, but the trips always feel so long
And I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me not to feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, working my day around the call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here, singing ""where'd you go?""

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Come back home, you know, the place where you used to live
Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween
With candy by the pile, but now
You only stop by every once in a while
Shit, I find myself just filling my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doing fine, and I'm I planning to keep it that way
You can call me if you find you have something to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career

Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so

Please come back home

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, no longer debating
Tired of sitting and hating and making these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless
It seems one thing has been true, all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back, I won't be here and you can sing it

Wherever You Will Go,ortoPilot,2011-12-12,"So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face

If a greater wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
And between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days

If a great wave shall fall
It will fall upon us all
Well I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go

Why Don't You And I,Santana,2002-09-30,"[Verse 1: Chad Kroeger]
Since the moment I spotted you
Like walking round with little wings on my shoes
My stomach's filled with the butterflies
Ooh, and it's alright
Bouncing 'round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If I said I didn't like it, then you know I'd lied, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
But every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

[Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
So I'll say, ""Why don't you and I get together
And take on the world and be together forever?
Heads we will, and tails we'll try again""
So I say, ""Why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?
'Cause without you, they're never gonna let me in""

[Verse 2: Chad Kroeger]
When's this fever going to break?
I think I've handled more than any man can take
I'm like a love-sick puppy chasing you around
Ooh, and it's alright
Bouncing 'round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If said I didn't like it, then you know I'd lied, ooh

Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard
With an open heart (I'm wide awake)
How did I read the stars so wrong? (I'm wide awake)
And now it’s clear to me
That everything you see
Ain’t always what it seems (I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long

I wish I knew then, what I know now
Wouldn’t dive in, wouldn’t bow down

Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine

I'm wide awake
Not losing any sleep
I picked up every piece
And landed on my feet (I'm wide awake)
Need nothing to complete myself, no (I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I am born again
Out of the lion's den
I don't have to pretend (And it's too late)
The story's over now, the end

何かを失い何かを得て今日も何か求めてる

[Pre-chorus: Jungkook, V]
そう変わること信じてるんだ
誰だって完璧じゃない
この瞬間さえも意味がある
そして音で繋がる woah

目を閉じてみれば
暗闇の中で my light, woah
照らしてあげるから
恐れず歩もう you & I, woah

[Post-chorus: Jungkook, V]
I’m your light, I’m your light
いつだって
君の心に差し込む
I’m your light, I’m your light
どんなに
離れていても届ける

[Verse 3:  SUGA, RM]
眠れない夜なんて
あり得ないと思ってた
でも嘘じゃないみたいだ
そしてまたget stronger
愛って何だろう？
答えがもしそこにあるなら
すぐ知りたい
I’m breaking down そんな中光が見える
どんな辛い夜さえも朝は来る
乗り越えるんだ未来さえも
もう止まらないよ
幸せの価値なんて自分で決めてしまえばいいんじゃない
そしてまた今日もgrow up

[Pre-chorus: Jimin, Jungkook]
でも弱さを見せる時もある
ありのままでいいのさ
もう自分に嘘はつかないで
全て音で繋がる, woah

[Chorus: Jin, V]
目を閉じてみれば
暗闇の中で your light, woah
照らしてくれるから
恐れず歩める you & I, woah

One to love, and one to lose

Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky

Took too much to ease the anger

Written In The Stars,Tinie Tempah,2010-05-31,"[Hook: Eric Turner]
Oh, written in the stars
A million miles away, a message to the main, oh
Seasons come and go, but I will never change
And I’m on my way
(Let's go!)

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, you’re listening now
They say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials
Cause I got more fuckin' hits than a disciplined child
So when they see me everybody brrrap, brrraps
Man I’m like a young gun fully black Barack
I cried tear drops over the Massive Attack
I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat
Look at my jacket and hat, so damn berserk
So down to earth, I’m bringing gravity back
Adopted by the major, I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed
Look, I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malorie Blackman
(Where the hell's all the sanity at?) Damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
That's why you have to keep screaming 'til they hear you out

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, I needed a change, when we ate, we never tipped
Because we needed the change, I needed a break
For a sec, I even gave up believing and praying
I even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray
They say that money is the root to the evilist ways
But have you ever been so hungry, it keeps you awake?
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed, great
It feels like a long time coming, fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream, I tried to chase it
But I wasn’t going nowhere, running man
I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Tryna change a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyone's a kid that no one cares about
You just gotta keep screaming until they hear you out

Where the west was all but won
All alone smoking his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?"" He said, ""Ask anything""

Lying on the floor, where were you, where were you?

Girl I've been all over the world

You'll be that girl
You'll be

Remember the words you told me
""Love me till the day I die""
Surrender my everything
'Cause you made me believe you’re mine
Yeah, you used to call me baby
Now you're calling me by name
Takes one to know one, yeah
You beat me at my own damn game

You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you

Lately our conversations
Sound like it's the last goodbye
One of us gets too drunk
And calls about a hundred times
So, who you been calling baby?
Nobody could take my place
When you're looking at those strangers
Hope to God you see my face

You're Beautiful,James Blunt,2005-08-08,"[Intro]
My life is brilliant

[Verse 1]
My life is brilliant, my love is pure
I saw an angel, of that I'm sure
She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan

[Chorus]
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face, in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, she caught my eye, as we walked on by
She could see from my face that I was, fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last 'til the end

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true

You Say,Lauren Daigle,2018-09-07,"[Verse 1]
I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I’m not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am, because I need to know

[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me
In You I find my worth, in You I find my identity

You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing

You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours

You've Got A Friend,Carole King,1971,"[Verse 1]
When you're down and troubled
And you need some loving care
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

[Chorus]
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

[Verse 2]
If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old North wind begins to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at your door

[Chorus]
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running, a-running, yeah, yeah-eah
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
Yes I will

Now ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, yes, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them
Oh, but don't you let them

[Chorus]
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running, a-running, yeah, yeah-eah
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yes I will (oh, yes I will)
