Debbie just hit the wall, she never had it all
One Prozac a day, husband's a CPA
Her dreams went out the door when she turned 24
Only been with one man, what happened to her plan?
She was gonna be an actress, she was gonna be a star
She was gonna shake her ass on the hood of Whitesnake’s car
Her yellow SUV is now the enemy
Looks at her average life, and nothing has been alright

[Hook]
Since Bruce Springsteen, Madonna
Way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie
And music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school
They tell her that she’s uncool
Cause she's still preoccupied
With 19, 19, 1985

[Verse 2]
She’s seen all the classics, she knows every line
Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, even Saint Elmo’s Fire
She rocked out to Wham, not a big Limp Bizkit fan
Thought she’d get a hand on a member of Duran Duran
Where’s the mini-skirt made of snake skin?
And who’s the other guy that's singing in Van Halen?
When did reality become TV?
Whatever happened to sitcoms, game shows?

[Hook]
On the radio was Springsteen, Madonna
Way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie
And music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school
They tell her that she’s uncool
Cause she's still preoccupied
With 19, 19, 1985

[Bridge]
She hates time, make it stop
When did Mötley Crüe become classic rock?
And when did Ozzy become an actor?
Please make this stop, stop, stop
And bring back

Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely

Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely

So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Before the morning sun, when life was lonely

I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old
Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be 30 years old

I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories

Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me

So I said, I'm a snowball running
Running down into the spring that's coming all this love
Melting under blue skies
Belting out sunlight
Shimmering love
Well, baby, I surrender
To the strawberry ice cream
Never ever end of all this love
Well, I didn't mean to do it
But there's no escaping your love, oh
These lines of lightning
Mean we're never alone
Never alone, no, no

Come on, come on
Move a little closer
Come on, come on
I wanna hear you whisper
Come on, come on
Settle down inside my love
Come on, come on
Jump a little higher
Come on, come on
If you feel a little lighter
Come on, come on

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you starin' at that phone in your lap
And you hopin' but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for if you had one chance?
So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late
I'm on my way, so don't close that gate
If I don't make that, then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now

Can we pretend that airplanes

Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Yeah, yeah, somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah, back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe, oh maybe, I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur—what's up, Bobby Ray?
So can I get a wish to end the politics?
And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes

[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

28,A Nightmare On My Street,DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince,2002-11-26,"[Intro: Fresh Prince]
Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy you all know him, he had me scared as hell!
He comes to me at night after I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred!
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot outside he wears it anyway!
He's gone when I'm awake but he shows up when I'm sleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare; on my street!

[Verse 1: Fresh Prince]
It was a Saturday evening, if I remember it right
And we had just gotten back off tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and bum rush the movies
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready Rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life
That was all right though 'cause the lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theater set to ill
We saw Elm Street and man it was def
And everything seemed all right when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare, but on my street!

[Verse 2: Fresh Prince & Freddy Kruger]
It was burning in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat, man, I was buggin'
I checked the clock and it stopped at 12:30
It had melted, it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty
I went downstairs to grab some juice or a Coke
Flipped the TV off, and then I almost choked
When I heard this awful voice comin' from behind
It said, ""You turned off David Letterman, now you must die!""
Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was
Broke outside in my drawers and screamed, ""So long, cuz!""
Got halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screamin'
Then thought, ""Oh, I get it, I must be dreamin""
I strolled back home with a grin on my grill
I figured since this is a dream I might as well get ill
I walked in the house, the Big Bad Fresh Prince
But Freddy killed all that noise real quick
He grabbed me by my neck and said
""Here's what we'll do, we got a lot of work here, me and you
The souls of your friends you and I will claim
You've got the body, and I've got the brain""
I said, ""Yo Fred, I think you've got me all wrong
I ain't partners with nobody with nails that long!
Look, I'll be honest, man, this team won't work
The girls won't be on you, Fred your face is all burnt!""
I pat him on the shoulder said, ""Thanks for stopping by.""
Then I opened up the door and said, ""Take care guy!""
He got mad, drew back his arm, and slashed my shirt
I laughed at first, then thought, ""Hold up, that hurt!""
It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real
I said, ""Freddy, uh, pal, there's been an awful mistake here.""
No further words and then I darted upstairs
Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed
Pulled the covers up over my head
And said, ""Oh please do somethin' with Fred!""
He jumped on my bed, ripped through the covers with his claws
Tried to get me, but my alarm went off
And then silence! It was a whole new day
I thought, ""Huh, I wasn't scared of him anyway.""
Until I noticed those rips in my sheets
And that was proof that there had been a nightmare, on my street

[Outro: Fresh Prince, Jazzy Jeff & Freddy Krueger]
Oh man, I gotta call Jeff, I gotta call Jeff
Come on, come on
Come on Jeff, answer
Come on, man

Taking my sulkin' to the masses

Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown

Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

Who's there? No one
Thinking that I deserve it

All I know is I'mma be okay

Was it all that easy
To just put aside your feelings?

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown

Cause it is my favorite holiday
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy

To add to my already mad rush
Just cause it's 'tis the season
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from

Last year, ski shop
Encounter, most interesting
Had his number but never the time
Most of '81 passed along those lines

So deck those halls, trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath
Christmas by myself this year

Calendar picture, frozen landscape
Chilled this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens, sparkling snow
Get this winter over with

Flashback to springtime, saw him again
Would've been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch

Didn't, of course, 'til summertime
Out to the beach to his boat could I join him?
No, this time it was me
Sunburn in the third degree

Now the calendar's just one page
And, of course, I am excited
Tonight's the night, but I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it

Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
But I think, I'll miss this one this year

But I think, I'll miss this one this year

But I think, I'll miss this one this year

But I think, I'll miss this one this year

Hardly dashing through the snow
Cause I bundled up too tight
Last minute have to do
A few cards a few calls

Cause it's ""RSVP""
No thanks, no party lights
It's Christmas eve, gonna relax
Turned down all of my invites

Last fall I had a night to myself
Same guy called, Halloween party
Waited all night for him to show
This time his car wouldn't go

Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late
Trudge on home to celebrate
In a quiet way, unwind
Doing Christmas right this time

A&P has provided me
With the world's smallest turkey
Already in the oven, nice and hot
Oh damn! Guess what I forgot?

So on, with the boots, back out in the snow
To the only all-night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year

""I'm spending this one alone,"" he said
""Need a break, this year's been crazy""
I said, ""Me too, but why are you?
You mean you forgot cranberries too?""

Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending

Listen, no, we don't need to be enemies
Ain't got tunnel vision
Vision of us in the future with a
White picket fence and eternal decisions
I almost did it, glad that I didn't

Got my space case but I'm sure that
All my friends fake 'cause they told me that
Shit wasn't real, it was all in my head, I imagined that
False sparks
Saw them hand-in-hand standing outside of a Wal-Mart
Now I'm sitting here wondering, when did this all start?

You don't know what that's like though
To wait up, wait up all night, though
To sleep, sleep with one eye closed
I'm blessed, yo, I'm blessed, yo

Spared me your treason for some unexplained reason, yeah
So I thank you for teaching me how I can live without you
Never needin' me, I don't need you

We never dressed to impress all the others
They would let us in on our laid back kinda style

Did you forget about how we went around?

Do you remember how when you were younger
The  summers all lasted forever?
Days  disappeared into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
I remember the summer Lil' Chano got ahold of his household
The  same summer that widowed Gwyneth Paltrow
Back  when I could trust in my dogs like Balto
My family The Sopranos, these niggas is altos
First  album, every track could be the outro
Velcro to shelltoes, things that we will outgrow
Used to rock South Pole, summers taking the 6 bus to South Shore
Never sold out but now we out-sold
That  was the summer I learned to love the great outdoors
Learned you get the feds if you can't keep yo' mouth closed
That summer left a couple marks like Groucho
That halo can turn hollow, depending how low
That summer left a couple tan lines
I love my city they let me cut the line on the Dan Ryan
They walk on eggshells and landmines
They communicate with handsigns

[Chorus: Ben Gibbard]
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

I remember the last summer of the teens
I can't recall too many summers in between
Will Smith, Genie, Donald Glover, Lion King
My daughter on the swing like the 2017 Cubs
My daughter mother double-ringed up
Finger look like jean cuffs, or two lean cups
Used to have obsession with the ""27 Club""
Now I'm turning twenty-seven, wanna make it to the 2070 club
Put the 27's down, Lord, give me a clean lung
Took the ring up out the box, I know this ain't no brief love
This story arc so sharp that it made the streets flood
This the type of covenant you keep love, deep love

Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing

[Chorus: Halsey & Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
To start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

Even when we’d argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow

If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love

Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flipping for my enemies
We could wait until the walls come down

It's time to give a little to the kids in the middle
But, oh until it falls won't bother me

You don't know how you met me, you don't know why
You can't turn around and say goodbye
All you know is when I'm with you, I make you free
And swim through your veins like a fish in the sea(17837211)
I'm singin'

[Chorus]
Follow me, everything is alright
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
And if you want to leave, I can guarantee
You won't find nobody else like me
I'm singin'
Follow me, everything is alright
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
And if you want to leave, I can guarantee
You won't find nobody else like me
I'm singin'

[Outro]
Follow me, everything is alright
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
And if you want to leave, I can guarantee
You won't find nobody else like me",72,0.439,0.817,0.585,0,0.147,-4.688,0.0301,0.916,105.014

172,Never Forget You,Zara Larsson,2017-03-17,"[Verse 1: Zara Larsson]
I used to be so happy, but without you here I feel so low
I watched you as you left, but I can never seem to let you go
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
It's buried deep inside me, but I feel there's somethin' you should know

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
I will never forget you
You will always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart, I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side 'til the day I die

[Post-Chorus: Zara Larsson]
'Til the day I die
'Til the day I die
'Til the day I die

[Verse 2: MNEK]
Funny how we both end up here, but everything seems so right
I wonder what would happen if we went back and put up a fight
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
So, what in this world do you think could ever take you off my mind? (Take you off my mind)

[Chorus: Zara Larsson & MNEK, MNEK]
I will never forget you
You will always be by my side (Be by my side)
From the day that I met you (Day I met you)
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart, I will always be sure (Be sure)
I will never forget you (Never forget you)
And you will always be by my side 'til the day I die

[Bridge: Zara Larsson & MNEK]
Feelin' it, lovin' it, everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had somethin' special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
But I'm still tied and I can't hide my connection with you
Feelin' it, lovin' it, everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had something special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
I can't hide my connection with you

[Chorus: Zara Larsson & MNEK, MNEK]
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side (You will always be my)
From the day that I met you (Day that I met you)
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart, I will always be sure (In my heart, I will be sure)
That I will never forget you (Never forget you)
And you will always be by my side 'til the day I die

[Outro: Zara Larsson, MNEK, Both]
Die, yeah

173,For You I Will (Confidence),Teddy Geiger,2006-03-21,"[Intro]
Alright, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm wandering the streets in a world underneath it all
Nothing seems to be
Nothing tastes as sweet as what I can't have
Like you and the way that you're twisting your hair 'round your finger
Tonight I'm not afraid to tell you
What I feel about you

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will

[Verse 2]
Forgive me if I st-stutter from all of the clutter in my head
Cause I could fall asleep in those eyes
Like a water-bed
Do I seem familiar? I've crossed you in hallways a thousand times
No more camouflage, I wanna be exposed
And not be afraid to fall

[Chorus 2]
Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
Always want what you can't have
But I've got to try
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
For you I will
For you I will
For you

[Bridge]
If I could dim the lights in the mall and create a moon
Yeah, I would
And shout out your name so it echoes in every room, yeah
That's what I'd do
That's what I'd do
To get through to you, yeah

[Chorus 2]
Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
You always want what you can't have
But I've got to try
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will

Oh, this the one right here, Wicked?

We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

[Verse 1]
I know you remember how I would hold you
Still remember how I approached you
I think I loved you 'fore I knew you

But everything I did for us
And us, I'm speakin' on my kids
Thinkin' 'bout this shit I did
Like how the hell I get myself involved in this bullshit?
Married to the game, I can't make you my fiancée
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyoncé
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck 'em I don't pay

I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine

Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman
Is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know

How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head

He began to dance around
Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say

He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day

So he said let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away
Down to the village

With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town

Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop
Frosty the snowman

Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying don't you cry
I'll be back again some day

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand

[Verse 3]
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation, and it looks like I'm the Queen
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, Heaven knows I've tried

Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well now they know

Let it go, let it go
Can't hold me back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway

It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all

It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free!

Let it go, let it go
I walk with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand
And here I'll stay
Let the storm rage on

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past

Let it go, let it go
When I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand
In the light of day

And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days

I was thinkin' 'bout the band
I was thinkin' 'bout the fans
We were underground
Loadin' merch in that 12-passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at
Still growin' up, still growin' up
I would lay in my bed and dream about what I'd become
Couldn't wait to get older, couldn't wait to be some
Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
Those good old days

I wish somebody would have told me, babe

Wish I didn't think I had the answers
Wish I didn't drink all of that flask first
Wish I made it to homecoming
Got up the courage to ask her
Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
And felt comfortable in myself
Rooftop open, and the stars above
Moment frozen, sneakin' out, and fallin' in love
Me, you and that futon, we'd just begun
On the grass dreamin', figuring out who I was
Those good old days

Maybe you always look back and think it was better than it was
Maybe these are the moments
Maybe I've been missin' what it's about
Been scared of the future, thinkin' about the past
While missin' out on now
We've come so far, I guess I'm proud
And I ain't worried 'bout the wrinkles 'round my smile

I've felt some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

[Pre-Chorus]
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times

My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so, and this I know for sure (Uh)
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door? (Ah)
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now (Uh)
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking to together 'cause we don't know how (C'mon)

You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it
But “got it” just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved
If what they say is “Nothing is forever”
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't want to hear me, you just want to dance

The ones who get undressed before the second date
Girls seem to like the boys who don't appreciate
All the money and the time that it takes

Got my both eyes out for Mr. Right
Guessing I just don't know where to find 'em
But I hope they all come out tonight

Talking them up about the things they do so well

235,How To Save A Life,The Fray,2005-09-13,"[Verse 1]
Step one, you say we need to talk
He walks, you say sit down; it's just a talk
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 2]
Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God He hears you
And pray to God He hears you, and

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 3]
As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

242,If Everyone Cared,Nickelback,2005-09-26,"[Verse 1]
From underneath the trees
We watch the sky
Confusing stars for satellites
I never dreamed that you'd be mine
But here we are, we're here tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Singing, Amen, I
I'm alive (I'm alive)
Singing Amen, I
I'm alive

[Chorus]
If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

[Post-Chorus]
And I'm singing
Amen, I, Amen, I
I'm alive
Amen, I, Amen, I, Amen, I
I'm alive

[Verse 2]
And in the air, the fireflies
Our only light in paradise
We'll show the world they were wrong
And teach them all to sing along

[Pre-Chorus]
Singing Amen, I
I'm alive (I'm alive)
Singing Amen, I
I'm alive

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died
If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died
When nobody died

[Bridge]
And as we lie beneath the stars
We realize how small we are
If they could love like you and me
Imagine what the world could be

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied

243,If I Ain't Got You,Alicia Keys,2003-12-02,"[Verse 1]
Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game
Some people think
That the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before
And that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

[Chorus]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

[Verse 2]
Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them
Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

[Chorus]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby

Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

[Verse 1]
I'm in Toronto and I got this view
But I might as well be in a hotel room, yeah
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
Spending all my nights reading texts from you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you

I can't write one song that's not about you

I'm so sorry that my timing's off
But I can't move on if we're still gonna talk
Is it wrong for me to not want half?
I want all of you, all the strings attached

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you

I'm trying to move on, forget you, but I hold on
Everything means nothing, everything means nothing, babe
I'm trying to move on, forget you, but I hold on
Everything means nothing if I can't have you, no

245,If I Were A Boy,Beyoncé,2008-11-14,"[Verse 1]
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus 1]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I'd know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

[Chorus 1]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

[Bridge]
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Chorus 2]
But you're just a boy
You don't understand
(Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted

246,If Today Was Your Last Day,Nickelback,2008-10-28,"[Verse 1]
My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride
(What if, what if?)

[Chorus 1]
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? (What if, what if?)
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have?
(What if, what if?)
If today was your last day
(What if, what if?)
(If today was your last day)

[Verse 2]
Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life
(What if, what if?)

[Chorus 2]
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? (What if, what if?)
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have? (What if, what if?)
And would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies? (What if, what if?)
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love? (That you finally fall in love)
If today was your last day

[Bridge]
If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes (Takes)
'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way (Way)
'Cause the hands of time are never on your side

[Chorus 2]
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have? (What if, what if?)
And would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies? (What if, what if?)

We're driving slow through the snow on Fifth Avenue
And right now radio's all that we can hear
Now we ain't talked since we left, it's so overdue
It's cold outside, but between us, it's worse in here

The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts

[Chorus]
I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's good-bye
To find a way that I can tell you

Slipping through our fingers

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone, when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh

Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know
That he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning
You're drowning
And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see
Now I see

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Ugh, yeah
See this a rather spooky action movie, roll it up and pass it to me
Hash and booty, absolutely, smack a groupie acting bourgie
See a creature, ass beauty, need a feature, rather shoot me
Truly bitches must have them bad jeans and back is Coogi
Had to do these rapper tunes to let 'em know the trap is booming
Past the views of Catholic schoolers, fact, but you in fact assuming
Back to doing cash pursuing, posted up like Patrick Ewing
Rapper feuds are sad if you would battle for a stack or two
These eloquent irrelevant sentences show my penmanship
Indefinite boundaries show you the end of it
Don't forget you infested in nasty crevices
Allowing birds to fall to their death before they even fly
He and I are not the same
Doctor, doctor, please prescribe me something for the pain
Money in machines, those will make you change
If I go tomorrow, I just hope it ain't in vain, but I can't complain

Point me to the road, and I'mma run it
Bloodhound with my nose to the money

Well, you done done me, and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks

Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention

To win some or learn some

I guess what I've been saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm yours

And how life was
Just you and me lovin' all of our friends

On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it, she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on

And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock

She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight""

She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else

But I keep coming back for more
She's just the girl I'm looking for

And the more she ignores me
The more I adore her

To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

Now we're sleeping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

So, come on, let it go, just let it be

Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?

It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

You're gonna be, a shinin' star

In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame

You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do they even exist?

I was working in the lab, late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

[Chorus]
He did the mash, he did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash
He did the mash, he did the monster mash

[Verse 2]
From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

[Chorus]
They did the mash, they did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
They did the mash, it caught on in a flash
They did the mash, they did the monster mash

[Verse 3]
The Zombies were having fun, the party had just begun
The guests included Wolfman, Dracula, and his son

The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group, 'The Crypt-Kicker Five'

[Chorus]
They played the mash, they played the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
They played the mash, it caught on in a flash
They played the mash, they played the monster mash

[Verse 4]
Out from the coffin', Drac's voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist and said
""Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?

It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash
The monster mash, it was graveyard smash
It's now the mash, it caught on in a flash
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash

Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band
And my Monster Mash is the hit of the land

When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you

You had a leopard beehive on your head (Are you dumb?)

(I) Fuck with your soul like shETHER
(Will) You ain't the queen, I'll show you
(Not) Lipo your ass and belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already
They told you your whole career
I'd come home and kill you, right? Ha-ha!

[Verse]
I told you I wasn't talkin' about your dumb-ass
It looks stupid, you literally got a dumb ass
Talkin' cray, and we all know that you dumb as
You get Donkey of the Day, yeah, you dumb ass
Let's be honest, you stole that line 'bout bitches bein' your sons
How you take my '09 jail tweet and run?
Talkin' about bringin' knives to a fight with guns
When the only shot you ever took was in your buns
And I saw Meek at All-Star, he told me your ass dropped
He couldn't fuck you for three months because your ass dropped
Now I don't think y'all understand how bad her ass got
The implants that she had put in her ass popped
I was like, ""Damn, 90 days and you couldn't have box?
Did she at least compensate? Start givin' you mad top?
Her name Minaj, right? She ain't throw you some bad thots?""
He said ""Nah,"" that's when I knew you was really a trash bop
You was screamin' ""Free Remy!"" when I was upstate doomed
But now that they freed Remy you don't sing the same tune
Locked me up, threw away my keys, threw away my weaves
Snatched me from my son, braids to the back, state greens
Daily News, ""Her career's over,"" ""She was kinda stupid,""
But you saw a opportunity 'cause you a opportunist
Left your Day 1 'cause you heard he was on some cheat shit
Then got with the dude that told you on some creep shit
But what happened to Omeeka? Nah, on some G shit
Left him and took a pic with the dude he had beef with?
And we all know it was a beef that you started
Pillow-talkin' out of your ass, this bitch retarded
Now you gotta die, you dearly departed
Bloodbath when I catch you, a real red carpet
Now what I'ma do, I'ma just stick to the facts
Bitch so scared of my future, got this bitch goin' backwards
Been through mad crews, you disloyal hoochie
Now all of a sudden you back with Drake and Tunechi?
After he said you sucked his dick, you back with Gucci?
Who next: Puff, Deb or Fendi? You a A-list groupie
And to be the Queen of Rap, you gotta actually rap
The whole industry know that your shit is a wrap
No, to be the Queen of Rap, you can't have a ghostwriter
And that's why this is my house; Flo Rida
Niggas done seen Drake pennin', Wayne pennin'
And since your first boyfriend left, bitch ain't winnin'
You a Internet troll, a Web browser, I'm sorry
You can't get a on line without Safaree
Mentionin' guns, you Pussy Galore, James Bond
Only time you touch a trigga is when you fucked Trey Songz
Coke head, you cheated on your man with Ebro
I might leak the footage of you sniffin' them ski slopes
They gassin' you up, but you been on E, though
""Pills and Potions,"" yep, you been on E, ho
Got your ghostwriters back, so you think you lit
Rem Belushi, I'm a Ghostbuster, bitch
I'm supposed to be scared
'Cause you bought your Barbie chain back?
I'll revert to ""Ante Up,"" you'll get your Barbie chain yapped
Tried to front in February, catch you in that Maybach
Show you how to use your name, you be usin' your name wack
I'm sayin', how you mix Nicki with a Minaj?
I'ma park this bitch, put Nicki in the garage
I'm gettin' money like Nicky Barnes, I'm the big homie
I responded in less than 48 Hours; Nick Nolte
Gettin' close like Nick Jonas, grippin' the gauge
Then blaze off, Face Off, bitch, Nicolas Cage
You animated like Nickelodeon, you fake, bitch
Only the kids believe in you; you St. Nick
Now when I shoot Nick at Nite, they won't understand it
I'm Wild'n Out, 'bout to hit Nick with the Cannon
How are you on the VMAs, actin' like you hood?
Way across the stage, talkin' about ""Miley, what's good?""
That's Hannah Montana, she was always happy
You only fronted on Mariah 'cause Mariah don't carry
Tried to disrespect Taylor 'cause Taylor wasn't Swift enough
Pillsbury Doughgirl; Remy pick the biscuit up
I'm jealous? Bitch, you was happy when they took me
Best thing that ever happened to you was when they booked me
You said you never fucked Wayne – how stupid I look, B?
Get the picture, I'll expose you, I'm kind of a bully
You named yourself Nicki Lewinsky, the mind of a rookie
'Cause you was suckin' his dick and now he tired of your nookie
You claimed you never fucked Drake
Now that's where you took me
You fucked the whole Empire – who you tryin' to be, Cookie?
Boogie Down Bronx, I come out of the Boogie
To let you know real bitches never lie on their pussy
And stop talkin' numbers, you signed a 360 deal
Through Young Money, through Cash Money, through Republic
Which means your money go through five niggas before you touch it
Any videos, promotions come out of your budget
Endorsements, tour and merchandise, they finger-fuck it
You make, like, 35 cents off of each ducat
I own my masters, bitch, independent
So for every sale I do, you gotta do like ten
Stop comparin' yourself to Jay, you not like him
You a motherfuckin' worker, not a boss like Rem
You're done, them pop chicks ain't get the news yet
Bitch, I pop chicks, yeah, and I'm the new vet
I kill rappers, and you good as dead, bitch
Talkin' shit about me to a deaf bitch
And usually I have sympathy for the impaired
But not when you hard of hearin' from untreated gonorrhea
But you point your fingers at me? I’m the bad girl
When she the one out here misleadin' the black girls?
All these fake-asses influenced by that girl
Dyin' from botched surgeries – what a sad world!
But before the butt job, you was a Spongebob
Suckin' cock for records, captain of the cum squad
And I got a few words for the moms of the young Barbz
Guess who supports a child molester? Nicki Minaj
You paid for your brother’s wedding? That’s hella foul
How you spendin' money to support a pedophile?
He a walkin' dead man, sendin' threats to him
I guess that’s why they call you Barbie, you was next to Ken
Talkin’ about your money long and your foreign sick
Why you ain’t help your bro hide his cum from forensics?
You probably somewhere overseas, foreign sick
Thought you could fuck with me, by far Rem sick
Meek, Drake, Safaree, I see men in your pants
We call that Jelani, get it? Semen in your pants
Uh, I got trigger fingers, you got bitter fingers
Yeah, you must think you Drake and I'm Twitter fingers
VH1, watch this
You just got bodied by a Love & Hip-Hop bitch

[Outro]
Don't ever in your fuckin' life play with me
That's on the set!
You tried it on the Rae Sremmurd record
You tried it on your little freestyle
They was both duds, just like every other one was duds
Just like this last one was a dud

It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
It's buried deep inside me, but I feel there's somethin' you should know

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
I will never forget you
You will always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart, I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side 'til the day I die

Funny how we both end up here, but everything seems so right
I wonder what would happen if we went back and put up a fight

So, what in this world do you think could ever take you off my mind? (Take you off my mind)

I will never forget you
You will always be by my side (Be by my side)

Feelin' it, lovin' it, everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had somethin' special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
But I'm still tied and I can't hide my connection with you

And all along, I knew I had something special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
I can't hide my connection with you

Thug nigga from the trenches never had a heart
Drug dealer, contract killer, loyal from the start (Start)

They say I'm pussy and they say I'm fake but I say

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Got into it with my bitch, caught up while I'm tourin'
Tryna see if shawty on my dick, wonder what she doin'
You know me, real G, I text ask her, ""How it's goin'""
She responded nothin', lookin' like to me you havin' fun
Look for my mama when I try to look inside my woman
Told my bae, ""I wish I woulda found you back when I was bummin'""
Stayed away from all the bullshit, them niggas said I'm runnin'
Time passed over now you see that I was chasin' money
Posted on Maryland, me and Von, his mama tearin' just once
Know you seen up in the parish, like check it out that's my lil' youngin'
Nigga don't wanna sell me a brick of dope, act like my money funny
Damn what you sayin' gangsta, you gon' make me take it from you
Some hoes say I'm handsome, some of them they say I'm ugly
Some say that I'm the realest but I still ain't sayin' nothin'

[Verse 3: Quando Rondo]
Tryna run me up a check, late nights, early mornings
Diamonds 'round my neck, they really wet, I could've copped a foreign
Givenchy shoes, I came a long way from Ralph Lauren
Cut off my ex because my new bitch put that pussy on me
They watchin' every move I make, I guess I'm settin' trends
I had to focus on the check, told myself, ""Fuck a friend""
Committed crimes so many times but I don't give a damn
I are who you say I am
Posted on high street, me and roof 'cause we been really thuggin'
Convicted felon with a dirty pistol, bitch I'm steady clutchin'
No drama sittin' in my cell like check out my lil' cousin
Can't trust these hoes because I know they come a dime a dozen
RIP to Quahfee, know my nigga at them Heaven gates
She ain't never really made love, I'm him just like Kevin Gates

[Verse 4: Kevin Gates]
20 of 'em comin', I switched to another spot
Reversible stock carbon, a new convertible drop
I was gambling with shawty, I put some work on the block
I tested her, she held a lil' quarter bird at her spot
I ain't into bustin' down a Rollie, bustin' down on bales
Don't wanna fuck me, I won't argue baby, oh well
The 18 Willard, the lever get 'em movin' mils
Millionaire dollar bond in 30 minutes and I made bail
I graduated, the square's outta town, at the room cookin' at the hotel (yeah, yeah)
Aux is outta reach, I'ma move the race car (Vroom)
Hated on us and they know who they are
Still livin' large as I aim for the stars
I'm a BreadWinner don and I came from the slums
I got a stain on my arm, weather through the storm
If I tell you that I love you then you can't do nothin' wrong
Surrounded by steppers, I got control in this bitch
I'll book you for a show and get you showed in this bitch
Tell that curb boy Trell I love you with all my heart
Now we ride around in Wraiths with a push button start (vroom)

'Cause baby, you’re worth it

'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me

Cocked your head to the side and said, ""I'm angry""
Five days since you laughed at me, saying
""Get that together, come back and see me""
Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry

Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
As I make you stop, think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes
Big like LeAnn Rimes, because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinking aching shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavours
Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know
The vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous, you'll have to sign a waiver

How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad

Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will

I have a history of taking off my shirt

It's been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air and said, ""You're crazy""
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees

You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry

Like Sting, I'm tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy
Like Kurosawa, I make mad films, 'kay, I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a Samurai
Gonna get a set of better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon

His face is on a T-shirt and his family traumatized
I didn't even mean to shoot him, he just caught me by surprise
I reloaded my pistol, cocked it back, and shot him twice
His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him it's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting 'round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for

Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you

Cause it was happy or I was sad
And it made me miss you oh so bad 'cause...

Okay, Coconut Man, Moonhead and Pea

Seems like everybody's got a price
I wonder how they sleep at night
When the sale comes first and the truth comes second
Just stop for a minute and smile
Why is everybody so serious?
Acting so damn mysterious
Got shades on your eyes
And your heels so high that you can't even have a good time

Everybody look to their left
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel that?
Yeah, we're paying with love tonight

Well, keep the price tag and take the cash back
Just give me six strings and a half stack
And you can keep the cars, leave me the garage
And all I, yes, all I need are keys and guitars
And it's within' 30 seconds, I'm leaving to Mars
Yeah, we leaping across these undefeatable odds

This one goes out to you and yours, worldwide

I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you

[Verse 1]
I've been a lot of places all around the way
I've seen a lot of joy and I've seen a lot of pain
But I don't want to write a love song for the world
I just want to write a song about a boy and a girl

Junkies on the corner always calling my name
And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games
When I saw you getting down, well, I hope it was you
And when I look into your eyes I knew it was true

[Chorus]
I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go

But I know one thing

I love you, I love you, I love you

[Verse 2]
Now I'm not a highly metaphysical man
But I know when the stars are aligned you can
Bump into a person in the middle of the road
Look into their eyes and you suddenly know

Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
Dancing in the night in the middle of June
My momma told me don't lose you
'Cause the best luck I had was you

You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

[Chorus 1]
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool
When I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed

I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Verse 2]
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

[Chorus 2]
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more
Than worth its weight in gold

Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old

Well, that is it, guys, that is all
Five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks back home
Sorry to leave, Mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone
All dried up in the desert sun?

My heart is breaking for my sister
And the con that she called ""love""
And then I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things
That can come from
Some terrible nights

The other night, you wouldn't believe
The dream I just had about you and me
I called you up, but we'd both agree

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too

I'll remember, you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead.""
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead.""

Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

Indulging in my self-defeat
My mind was thugged, all laced and bugged, all twisted, wrong and beat

Impaired my tribal lunar speak
And of course you can't become if you only say what you would have done

Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote
Make me your radio (Yeah, ha ha)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you (Right there)
Just sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Heroes, baby!)

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yikky-yeah check it, Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artefacts

[Pre-Chorus 1: Travie McCoy]
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I’d sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no— (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
If I was an old-school, fifty-pound boombox (Remember them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (Turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop (Peace)
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (Never know)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Travie McCoy]
I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you could hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune

Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh oh oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, uh, a fresh cool young Lu
Trying to catch his microphone, check 2-1-2
Wanna believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees, what have you brung you?
Did you improve on the design, did you do something new?
Well your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You, the more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too
And then it hit me, standing outside of Heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me, I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung ""Blue""
Go back, whatever you did you undo
Heavy as heaven, the devil on me, two tons too

And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down to the basement, past the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid
Then out through China, nearly miss the airliners
Magnified times five, unless it's pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze
Now that's important to say
Cause even with all that most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid
Meaning we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called and he told him to wait
Unstrap him from the chair and put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gonna clap and they ain't gonna praise
They want everything back that they've paid
Cause they've been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim

So chauffeur, chauffeur, come and take me away
Cause I've been standing in this line for like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front, they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say ""You need to go and see that""
And everybody claps cause everybody is pleased
And then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like, ""Ha ha ha-ha-ha

[Chorus]
But, darling
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

[Verse 2]
Maybe I know, somewhere
Deep in my soul, that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone, but keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn to myself
That I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

[Chorus]
Well, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

[Bridge]
I've got a tight grip on reality
But I can't, let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning, when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Now
Walk into the club like, ""What up? I got a big cock""
Nah, I’m just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like, ""Damn, that’s a cold ass honkey""
Rollin' in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink; 'cept my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standin' next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets
Piss...
But shit, it was 99 cents!
Fuck it, coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins someone else has been walkin' in
Bummy and grungy, fuck it, man
I am stunting and flossin' and saving my money
And I'm hella happy; that’s a bargain, bitch!
I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa
Can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you!)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my mellow
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make 'em cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like, ""Ah, he got the Velcros.""

[Chorus: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
What you know about rockin' a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowin' about wearin' a fur fox skin?
I'm diggin', I'm diggin'
I'm searchin' right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come up
Thank your granddad for donatin' that plaid button-
up shirt 'cause right now, I'm up in hurr stuntin'
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the bins
I'm not, I'm not stuck on searchin' in that section (Mens)
Your grammy, your auntie, your mama, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies
Second hand and I'll rock that, motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on the motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, ""Oh, that Gucci? That's hella tight""
I'm like, ""Yo, that's 50 dollars for a T-shirt""
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
50 dollars for a T-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting-swindled-and-pimped shit
I call that getting tricked by business
That shirt's hella dough
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Tryna get girls from a brand?
Man, you hella won't! Man, you hella won't!

It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking from the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus 1: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah, ooh

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

[Chorus 2: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with 40 eyes, girl

And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
They're open wide
This is the end of your life, ooh

They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side, ooh
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

[Chorus 3: Michael Jackson]
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller

And share a killer, thriller

[Outro: Vincent Price & Michael Jackson]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller, ooh, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller night, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Ooh, babe, I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller night, babe
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40 thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!

529,Waiting On The World To Change,John Mayer,2006-09-11,"[Verse 1]
Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

[Chorus]
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

[Verse 2]
Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
But when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Because when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want

[Chorus]
That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight isn't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

[Guitar Solo]

And we're still waiting

Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end

Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes

And love is the prize

Shadows fill an empty heart
As love is fading
From all the things that we are
Are not saying
Can we see beyond the scars
And make it to the dawn?

And open up to
The ways you made me feel alive
The ways I loved you
For all the things that never died
To make it through the night
Love will find you

What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?
Baby, before it's too late
What about now?

To start a new day
This broken heart can still survive
With a touch of your grace
As shadows fade into the light
I am by your side
Where love will find you

But I’m doin’ It
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still harder

But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

But I'm okay with it, I admit the lyrics are weak
I've been workin' on 'em, I'll be good eventually
I understand you gotta crawl before you get to your feet
But I been running for a while, they ain't ready for me, ahh
I know this prolly isn't really realistic
And honestly, I might not ever make a difference
But that don't make a difference, I'ma have to risk it
I've been crunchin' numbers, you ain't gotta be a mathematician
To see the odds ain't rootin' for me
I can't lie though, it's kinda how I like it to be
The underdog, yeah, you prolly think you know what I mean
But what I'm saying is they ever push me, I'm gonna swing, yeah
I could go to college, get in debt like everybody else
Graduate and prolly get a job that doesn't pay the bills
That don't make a lot of sense to me, forget the Happy Meals
I don't like the dollar menu, I would rather make a meal
Huh? Make a mil'? Nah, I said make a meal

Quiet when I'm tryna sing, quiet when I'm making beats
Quiet when I'm tryna think, sorry, I don't mean to scream

Come on, I can spit it really fast, ""No""

Have a tour bus and maybe even play a couple shows

Tellin' me that I am not the only one that feels alone

Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
She said, ""Some days, I feel like shit
Some days, I wanna quit and just be normal for a bit""
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along, but the trips always feel so long
And I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me not to feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, working my day around the call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here, singing ""where'd you go?""

Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so

Please come back home

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Come back home, you know, the place where you used to live
Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween
With candy by the pile, but now
You only stop by every once in a while
Shit, I find myself just filling my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doing fine, and I'm I planning to keep it that way
You can call me if you find you have something to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career

I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, no longer debating
Tired of sitting and hating and making these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless
It seems one thing has been true, all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back, I won't be here and you can sing it

564,Who Says You Can't Go Home,Bon Jovi,2005-01-01,"[Verse 1]
I spent 20 years trying to get out of this place
I was looking for something I couldn't replace
I was running away from the only thing I've ever known
Like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold
I been there, done that and I ain't looking back on the seeds I've sown
Saving dimes, spending too much time on the telephone
Who says you can't go home

[Chorus]
Who says you can't go home
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rolling stone, who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go back, been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go, who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright

[Verse 2]
I went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I lived a million miles of memories on that road
With every step I take I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known
Who says you can't go home

Who says you can't go home

It's been a long long road

Gotta break loose cause that's the motto

Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, you’re listening now
They say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials
Cause I got more fuckin' hits than a disciplined child
So when they see me everybody brrrap, brrraps
Man I’m like a young gun fully black Barack
I cried tear drops over the Massive Attack
I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat
Look at my jacket and hat, so damn berserk
So down to earth, I’m bringing gravity back
Adopted by the major, I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed
Look, I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malorie Blackman
(Where the hell's all the sanity at?) Damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
That's why you have to keep screaming 'til they hear you out

Because we needed the change, I needed a break
For a sec, I even gave up believing and praying
I even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray
They say that money is the root to the evilist ways
But have you ever been so hungry, it keeps you awake?
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed, great
It feels like a long time coming, fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream, I tried to chase it
But I wasn’t going nowhere, running man
I knew that maybe someday I would understand

Remember the words you told me
""Love me 'til the day I die""
Surrender my everything
'Cause you made me believe you're mine
Yeah, you used to call me baby
Now you're calling me by name
Takes one to know one, yeah
You beat me at my own damn game

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I’m just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Luke]
Lately our conversations
End like it's the last goodbye
Then one of us gets too drunk
And calls about a hundred times
So, who you been calling baby?
Nobody could take my place
When you’re looking at those strangers
Hope to God you see my face

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I’m just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Bridge: Luke]
You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take
You're running around and I'm running away
Running away from you, mmm, from you

[Chorus: All]
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I’m just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

585,You're Beautiful,James Blunt,2005-08-08,"[Intro]
My life is brilliant

[Verse 1]
My life is brilliant, my love is pure
I saw an angel, of that I'm sure
She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan

[Chorus]
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face, in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, she caught my eye, as we walked on by
She could see from my face that I was, fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last 'til the end

[Chorus]
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face, in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

(Na na na na, na na na na, na na na na, na)

[Outro]
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
There must be an angel, with a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you
But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you",78,0.633,0.675,0.479,1.76e-05,0.088,-9.87,0.0278,0.454,81.998
586,You Say,Lauren Daigle,2018-09-07,"[Verse 1]
I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I’m not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am, because I need to know

[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

[Verse 2]
The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me
In You I find my worth, in You I find my identity

[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

[Bridge]
Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at Your feet
You have every failure, God
You'll have every victory

[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

587,You've Got A Friend,James Taylor,1971,"When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, whoa, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest nights

Should turn dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind
Should begin to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud now
Soon I be knocking
Upon your door

And desert you
