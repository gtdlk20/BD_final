She never had it all
One Prozac a day
Husband's a CPA

Her dreams went out the door
When she turned 24
Only been with one man
What happened to her plan?

She was gonna be an actress
She was gonna be a star
She was gonna shake it fast
On the hood of Whitesnake's car

Her yellow SUV
Is now the enemy
Looks at her average life
And nothin'-has been-alright

Springsteen, Madonna
Way before Nirvana
There was U2, and Blondie
And music still on MTV

Her two kids, in high school
They tell her that she's uncool
'Cause she's still preoccupied
With 19, 19, 1985!

She's seen all the clasics
She knows every line
Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink
Even St. Elmo's Fire

She rocked out to Wham!
Not a big Limp Bizkit fan
Thought she'd get a hand
On a member of Duran Duran

Where's the mini skirt
Made of snake skin?
Who's the other guy thats
Singing in Van Halen?

When did reality-become TV
Whatever happened to
Sitcoms!-Game Shows!-
(all the radio)

Springsteen, Madonna
Way before Nirvana
There was U2, and Blondie
And music still on MTV

Her two kids, in highschool
They tell her that she's uncool
'Cause she's still preoccupied
With 19, 19, 1985!

She hates time
Make it stop
""When did my Motley Crew become clasic rock? (classic rock)

""And when did Ozzy
Become an actor?
Please make this
STOP, STOP, STOP!""

And bring back Springsteen, Madonna
Way before Nirvana
There was U2, and Blondie
And music still on MTV

Her two kids, in high school
They tell her that she's uncool
'Cause she's still preoccupied
With 19,19,1985!

The day you kissed my lips
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better
Than the summer of 2002 (Ooh)

But acting like grown-ups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing, ""Love is forever and ever""
Well, I guess that was true

Singing at the top of both our lungs

Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven hanging out and thinking we were slicker
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was twenty years old

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing about everything, I saw before me
Once I was twenty years old
Soon we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learning about life
I hope I have children for me?
So I can sing them all my songs and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind my brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be sixty years old
Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
