0,1985,Kidz Bop Kids,2005-02-22,"Debbie just hit the wall
She never had it all
One Prozac a day
Husband's a CPA

Her dreams went out the door
When she turned 24
Only been with one man
What happened to her plan?

She was gonna be an actress
She was gonna be a star
She was gonna shake it fast
On the hood of Whitesnake's car

Her yellow SUV
Is now the enemy
Looks at her average life
And nothin'-has been-alright

Springsteen, Madonna
Way before Nirvana
There was U2, and Blondie
And music still on MTV

Her two kids, in high school
They tell her that she's uncool
'Cause she's still preoccupied
With 19, 19, 1985!

She's seen all the clasics
She knows every line
Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink
Even St. Elmo's Fire

She rocked out to Wham!
Not a big Limp Bizkit fan
Thought she'd get a hand
On a member of Duran Duran

Where's the mini skirt
Made of snake skin?
Who's the other guy thats
Singing in Van Halen?

When did reality-become TV
Whatever happened to
Sitcoms!-Game Shows!-
(all the radio)

Springsteen, Madonna
Way before Nirvana
There was U2, and Blondie
And music still on MTV

Her two kids, in highschool
They tell her that she's uncool
'Cause she's still preoccupied
With 19, 19, 1985!

She hates time
Make it stop
""When did my Motley Crew become clasic rock? (classic rock)

""And when did Ozzy
Become an actor?
Please make this
STOP, STOP, STOP!""

And bring back Springsteen, Madonna
Way before Nirvana
There was U2, and Blondie
And music still on MTV

Her two kids, in high school
They tell her that she's uncool
'Cause she's still preoccupied
With 19,19,1985!

Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven hanging out and thinking we were slicker
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was twenty years old

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing about everything, I saw before me
Once I was twenty years old
Soon we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learning about life
I hope I have children for me?
So I can sing them all my songs and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind my brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be sixty years old
Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold

Yeah, I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and cashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you starin' at that phone in your lap
And you hopin' but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for if you had one chance?
So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Yeah, somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah, back when I was tryin' to get a tip at subway
And back when I was rappin' for the thrill of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe, oh, maybe I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mix tape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for the hater, what's up, Bobby Ray
So can I get a wish to end the politics?
And get back to the music that started this hit
So here I stand, and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

With a toy on Christmas day

I don't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake
To hear those magic reindeer's click

'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you, you, baby

All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air

And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Standing right outside my door

Left without a word and nothing to say
(Nothing to say)
When I was the one who gave you my heart and soul
But it wasn't good enough for you, no
So I asked God

God send me an angel from the Heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart
From bein' in love 'cause all I do is cry
God send me an angel
To wipe the tears from my eyes

And I know it might sound crazy
But after all that I still loved you
You wanna come back in my life
But now there is something I have to do

I have to tell the one that I once adored
(That they can't have my love no more)
'Cause my heart can't take no more lies
And my eyes are all out of cries
So God

God send me an angel from the Heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart
From bein' in love 'cause all I do is cry
(All I do is cry)
God send me an angel
(Send an angel)
To wipe the tears from my eyes

Now you had me on my knees
Begging God please to send you back to me
I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep
You made me feel like I could not breathe
(Breathe)

Now all I wanted to do was to feel your touch
And give you all my love
(Give you all my love)
But you took my love for granted
Want my lovin' now but you can't have it God

28,A Nightmare On My Street,Kidz Bop Kids,2012-09-11,"Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy, you all know me I was scared as hell
He comes to me at night when I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot outside, he wears it anyway
He's home when I'm awake, but he shows up when I sleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare, on my street
It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right
And we had just gotten off of tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and down watch a movie
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready Rock got some girl I've never seen in my life
That was alright though, 'cause lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theatre set to ill
Buggin' , cold havin' a ball
And somethin' 'bout Elm Street was the movie we saw
The way it started was decent
You know, nothin' real fancy
About this homeboy named Fred
And this girl named Nancy
But, word! When it was over, I said, ""Yo, that was def!""
And everything seemed alright when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare, on my street
It was burnin' in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat, and man, I was buggin'
I checked the clock, and it stopped at 12 30
It had melted it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty
I wanted something cool to quench my thirst
I thought to myself, Yo! This heat is the worst
But when I got downstairs, I noticed something was wrong
I was home all alone, but the TV was on
I thought nothin' of it as I grabbed the remote
I pushed the power button, and I then almost choked
When I heard this awful voice comin' from behind, it said
""You are my favorite rapper, but now you must die!""
Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was
Broke inside my drawers and screamed, ""So long 'cause!""
Got halfway up the block, I calmed down and stopped screamin'
And thought, Oh, I get it, I must be dreamin'
I strolled back home with a grin on my grill
I'm thinkin' since this is a dream, I might as well get ill
I walked in the house, the big, bad, Fresh Prince
But Freddy killed all that noise real quick
He grabbed me by my neck and said
""Here's what we'll do. We've got a lotta work here, me and you
The souls of your friends, you and I will claim
You've got the body, and I've got the brains.""
I said, ""Yo, Fred. I think you've got me all wrong
I ain't partners with nobody with nails that long
Look, I'll be honest man, this team won't work
The girls won't be yours, Fred, your face is all burnt""
Fred got mad and his head started steamin'
But I thought what the hell, I'm only dreamin'
I said, ""Please leave Fred, so I can get some sleep
But gimme a call, and maybe we'll hang out next week.""
I pat him on the shoulder, say, ""Thanks for stoppin' by.""
Then I opened up the door and said, ""Take care, guy!""
He got mad, threw back his arm, and slashed my shirt
I laughed at first, then thought, Hold up, that hurt
It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real
I said, ""Freddy, uh, uh, there's been an awful mistake here.""
No further words, and then I darted upstairs
Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed
Pulled the covers up over my head and said
""Oh please, do somethin' with Fred!""
He jumped on my bed and threw the covers with his claws
Tried to get me but my alarm went off. and then
Silence
It was a whole new day, I thought
Heh, I wasn't scared of him, anyway
Until I noticed those rips in my sheets
And that was proof that there had been a nightmare, on my street
Oh man, I gotta call Jeff, I gotta call Jeff
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon Jeff, answer
C'mon man
Hello
Jeff, it's Prince man, Jeff, wake up Jeff, wake up
What do you want?
Jeff, wake up, man. Listen to me. Jeff
It's 3 O'clock in the morning, what do you want?

I cannot cry because a moments weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break when it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I'll never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you cry, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night for the same old thing

Because of you
I'll never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to stay on the safe side, so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I tried my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in

Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

51,Behind These Hazel Eyes,Kidz Bop Kids,2006-02-21,"Seems just like yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything felt so right
Unbreakable like nothing could go wrong
Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am
Once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it
Can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright
For once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
Sewn together, but so broken up inside
Cause I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am
Once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it
Can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Swallow me, then spit me out
For hating you I blame myself
Seeing you it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside anymore

Going, coming, thought I heard a knock
Who's there? No one
Thinking that I deserve it
Now I realize that I really didn't know

If you didn't notice, you mean everything
Quickly I'm learning to love again
All I know is I'mma be okay

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time

Even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

I couldn't turn on the TV
Without something there to remind me
Was it all that easy
To just put aside your feelings?

If I'm dreaming, don't wanna laugh
Hurt my feelings but that's the path
I'll believe in, and I know time will heal it

If you didn't notice, boy you mean everything
Quickly I'm learning to love again

And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreaming of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray

Try not to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no-one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I'd pray
I could break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance
Make a change, and break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance
Make a change, and break away

Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train

Travel on a jetplane
Fall away, and break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
Gotta make a wish, take a chance
Make a change, and break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love
I've gotta take a risk, take a chance
Make a change, and break away

Building with a 100 floors
Swinging with revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me
But I gotta keep moving on moving on
Fly away, break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
Tho its not easy to tell you goodbye
Gotta take a risk, take a chance
Make a change, and break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun

Return of the Mack, get up!
What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit
Get up! Fresh out, pimp strut walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby. Sweater gang, nope, nope y'all can't copy
Yup. Bad, moon walking, this here is our party, my posse's been on Broadway
And we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pa** the torch and put on for my town

But that's what you get when Wu Tang raised you

And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on shark week
Raw. Tell me go up. Gone!
Deuces goodbye. I got a world to see, and my girl she wanna see Rome
Caesar make you a believer. Now I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now sing this song and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me
If I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure gain humility and then we keep marching ourselves

104,Christmas Wrapping,Kidz Bop Kids,2012-10-02,"""Bah, humbug!"" No, that's too strong
'Cause it is my favorite holiday
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy

To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from

Last year, ski shop
Encounter, most interesting
Had his number but never the time
Most of '81 passed along those lines

So deck those halls, trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath
Christmas by myself this year

Calendar picture, frozen landscape
Chilled this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens, sparkling snow
Get this winter over with!

Flashback to springtime, saw him again
Would've been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch

Didn't, of course, 'til summertime
Out to the beach to his boat could I join him?
No, this time it was me
Sunburn in the third degree

Now the calendar's just one page
And, of course, I am excited
Tonight's the night, but I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Hardly dashing through the snow
Cause I bundled up too tight
Last minute have-to-do's
A few cards a few calls
'Cause it's r-s-v-p
No thanks, no party lights
It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax
Turned down all of my invites

Last fall I had a night to myself
Same guy called, Halloween party
Waited all night for him to show
This time his car wouldn't go

Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late
Trudge on home to celebrate
In a quiet way, unwind
Doing Christmas right this time

A&P has provided me
With the world's smallest turkey
Already in the oven, nice and hot
Oh damn! Guess what I forgot?

So on with the boots, back out in the snow
To the only all-night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year!

""I'm spending this one alone,"" he said
""Need a break; this year's been crazy.""
I said, ""Me too, but why are you?
You mean you forgot cranberries too?""

Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending! ""

That you would ever feel the same way
About me, it's just too much, just too much

All I ever think about is you
You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
And I've just got to know

Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we can be, where this thing can go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it real or just another crush?

Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back like the way I do?
'Cause I'm trying, trying to walk away
But I know this crush ain't goin' away, goin' away

Has it ever crossed your mind
When we're hanging, spending time girl
Are we just friends? Is there more? Is there more?

See it's a chance we've gotta take
'Cause I believe that we can make this into
Something that will last, last forever, forever

All that we can be, where this thing can go?

And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One song and you're outta my mind

Baby, I wanna hide
You're alone, going out of your mind

Details don't matter, we both paid the price
Tears in my eyes, you know sometimes
It'd be like that, baby, yeah

Now every time I see you
I pretend I'm fine
When I wanna reach out to you

We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best

I can see it in your eyes, you still want it

Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Oh, they say that you're in a new relationship
But we both know, nothing compares to
What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it, how good we used to get it

There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine
No matter what you go through
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride

Fire pass us by

I went to the moped store and said what if
Salesman like what up what’s your budget
And I’m like honestly I don’t know nothing about mopeds
He said I got the one for you
Follow me
Whooo It’s too real
Chromed out mirror I don’t need a windshield
Banana seat a canopy on two wheels
800 cash it’s a steal of a deal
I'm headed downtown cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing through the streets like Dally
Pulled up moped to the valley
Whitewalls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope
My crew is ill and all we need is two good wheels
Got gas in the tank cash in the bank
And a cute little mama with a smile on her face
I’m the same that dance that break it off Kit-Kat
Pull her up (inaudible) you don't need a wristband
Nope

[Chorus]
Downtown
Downtown, downtown (downtown)
Downtown, downtown
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that could keep us safe
Have you ever felt the warm embrace
Of the leather seat under your legs
Downtown
You don't want no beef boy
Know I run the streets boy
Better follow me towards
Downtown
What you see is what you get girl
Don't ever forget girl
Ain't seen nothing yet until you're

You don't want no beef boy
Know I run the streets boy
Better follow me towards

Cut the business
Get off my mullet
Stone washed so raw
Moped like a record
It can't catch me
A neighbor can't reprimand me
I'm in a B-Boy stance
I'm not dancing
I got my friend in the back doing tandem
Because I'm too too quick, I'm too too slick
Whole downtown yelling out
Who that is
It's me, the K the I-D the Z
Stunting like a Fresh Prince you remember me
I take her to pond alright
And I watch her skate
I mean water ski ollie ollie oxen free
I'm perusing down fourth and they watching me
I do a handstand an eagle lands on my seat
Well hello how you doing my moped is free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me
I got one girl
I got two wheels
She a smart girl but ain't a big deal
I like a smart girl
I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Backstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like
You need to slow down
Going thirty-eight man
You need to chill out
Mow your own lawn and sit right back down
If I only had one helmet I would give it to you give it to you
Cruising down Broadway girl
What a wonderful view wonderful view
There's layers to this like tiramisu tiramisu
Let my coat tail drag but I ain't tearing my suit tearing my suit

When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, stayed in touch
Used to talk underneath the light on the back of the bus
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way to stay on the phone and talk real late

[Pre-Chorus]
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the seat
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

[Chorus]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your whole life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

[Verse 2]
17, and you have a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, uh, suddenly, you turned 23
Now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set

Drive down to the coast, jump in the seat
Just take my hand and come with me, singin'

When we were a little bit older, both done
I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me and rumours are knee deep
The truth is it's easier to ignore it, believe me
I made some mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny

I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, never say it

Just another ex-love, you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)

I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your handprints on my soul
It's like your eyes are bigger, it's like your body is gold

Although we both sit close together
We feel miles apart inside
Was it something I said or something I did
Did my words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried
But I guess that's why they say

'Every rose has it's thorn'
Just like every night has it's dawn
Just like every cowboy
Sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has it's thorn

Listening to our favorite song
On the radio
Hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and easy go
But I wonder
Does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow
I guess

'Every rose has it's thorn'
Just like every night has it's dawn
Just like every cowboy
Sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has it's thorn
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains
I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways
And now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife

Lit up the world as I fell asleep

And leave teardrops everywhere

That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay
Awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance

A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

I'd like to make myself believe

Awake when I'm asleep

(Please take me away from here)

Why do I tire of counting sheep
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep

To ten million fireflies

I got misty eyes as they said farewell
(Said farewell)

If my dreams get real bizarre

And I keep them in a jar

But no one seems to hear a thing

With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the Snowman is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow but the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the Snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me, come on

Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

Oh Frosty the Snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, ""Let's run and we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away""

Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there, all around the square
Sayin', ""Catch me if you can!""

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard him holler, ""Stop!""

Hey, Frosty the Snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye, sayin', ""Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day""

But she fell in love with an English friend
Kissed her on the cheek and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""

I met her on Grafton street right outside of the store
She sang a song to me and taught me how to play the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic thing on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to sing on?
She took me out to a party just for the fun
We were singing at the table with our friends all singing along
Chatted some more, with our sung guitar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

And then she look at me like there was nobody else in the room

After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the back using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

Wish I didn't think all of that stuff first
Wish I made it to homecoming
Got up the courage to ask her
Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
Wish I put those things back on that shelf
Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
And felt comfortable in myself
Rooftop open, and the stars above
Moment frozen, sneakin' out, and fallin' in love

On the grass dreamin', figuring out who I was

Straight off the silver screen

So I'll be holding my own breath right up 'til the end
Until that moment when I find the one that I'll spend forever with

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that

And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Every argument, every word we can't take back

I think that we both know the way that this story ends

Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

219,Here With Me,Kidz Bop Kids,2019-06-28,"[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Over here just where I wanna be
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

[Verse 2]
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
Pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy I'm givin' up
Cause I can't take him saying stuff no more
Oh God why am I here?

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

[Bridge]
Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here

240,How To Save A Life,Kidz Bop Kids,2007-07-31,"Step one, you say, we need to talk
He walks, you say, sit down, it's just a talk
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through

Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
And you begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence

Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
Pray to God he hears you
And pray to God he hears you

And where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours, grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed

He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend

I'm thinking about you all the time
But you're out there
And I'm here waiting

And I wrote this letter in my head
'Cause so many things were left unsaid
But now you're gone
And I can't think straight

This could be the one last chance
To make you understand

I'd do anything
Just to hold you in my arms
To try and make you laugh
Somehow I can't put you in my past

I'd do anything
Just to hold you in my arms
Will you remember me?
'Cause I know I won't forget you

Together we broke all the rules
Dreaming of droping out of school

He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had, if today was your last day?
What if, what if, if today was your last day?

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the price is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you're never living twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?

And would you call those friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies?
And would you find that one you're dreaming of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you'd finally fall in love if today was your last day?

If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are

So do whatever it takes
'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothing stand in your way
'Cause the hands of time are never on your side

If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?

And would you call those friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies?

Alone?

It ends tonight, it ends tonight

It's better than being on your side
It's my fault when you're blind
It's better that I see it through your eyes

On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go
And she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year, she had a lot on her mind
And she didn't pay attention, she was going way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared she threw her hands up in the air
Jesus take the wheel, take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go, so give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on, Jesus take the wheel
It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time she bowed her head to pray
She said I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life, I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight
Jesus take the wheel, take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go, so give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Ooh, Jesus take the wheel, ooh, I'm letting go

Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation

Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know!

Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door!
I don't care
What they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway!
It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all!
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me I'm free!
Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry!
Here I stand
And here I'll stay
Let the storm rage on!
My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back
The past is in the past!

Let it go, let it go

You mean well, but you make this hard on me

That they all say things you wanna hear

I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On the balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet!""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go!""
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet!""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go!""
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes

Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes

Oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said

Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know

It caught on in a flash

To the master bedroom where the vampires feast

Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds

They played the mash

When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I've held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

You used to captivate me by your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face, it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice, it chased away all the sanity in me

But I was wonderin' if there was somethin' that you wanna know
But never mind that, we should let it go

Three days since the living room

Yesterday you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days till I say I'm sorry

Hold it now and watch the hoodwink as I make you stop, think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the Sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan

Hot like wasabe when I bust rhymes
Big like Le Ann Rimes because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through

'Cause it's so dangerous, you'll have to sign a waiver

Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy

Gonna get a set a' better clubs, gonna find the kind with tiny nubs

Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon

Remember when we couldn't take the heat?

I can't believe you were the one
To build me up and tear me down
Like an old abandoned house

What you said when you left
Just left me cold and out of breath
Felt if I was in way too deep
Guess I let you get the best of me

Well, I never saw it coming
I should have started running
Long, long time ago

And I never thought I'd doubt you
I'm better off without you
More than you, more than you know

I'm slowly getting closure
I guess it's really over
I'm finally getting better

And now I'm picking up the pieces
Spending all of these years
Putting my heart back together

The day I thought I'd never get through
I got over you

You took a hammer to these walls
Dragged the memories down the hall
Packed your bags and walked away
There was nothing I could say

When you slammed the front door shut
A lot of others opened up
So did my eyes, so I could see
That you never were the best for me

Well, I never saw it coming
I should have started running
Long, long time ago

Standing there with the frown, like you only get
Posting pictures every trip on the internet

Getting lost in the past, we were living it

I get restless and senseless

Make me happy, it's your mission

We danced the night away
We sang so much
I held your hand
That way you were singing, oh

I said I thought you were the best
And you asked me to stand closer
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold

Just got me praying that it's longer, feeling something rotten
Last time I saw you, said “What’s up?” and pushed right through
Then I tried to catch you, but we’re always on the move
And now it’s over, we’re older, symptoms of the culture
And the night ain’t getting younger, next day’s around the corner
Feeling kinda tempted and I’m pouring out the truth
Just fading out these talkers ‘cause now all I want is you

But why do I always feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone, and

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?

When I come home at night
I bolt the door real tight
People call me on the phone I'm trying to avoid
Well, can the people on T.V. see me
Or am I just paranoid?

When I'm in the shower
I'm afraid to wash my hair
'Cause I might open my eyes
And find someone standing there
People say I'm crazy
Just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me of
""Psycho"" too much

Like when you said you felt so happy you could cry
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end
Always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
And I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love

What do I stand for?
What do I stand for?
Most nights I don't know anymore...

This is it, boys, this is war - what are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
Save that for the black and white
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style
That's alright (that's alright)

She stops my bones from wondering just who I am, who I am, who I am
Oh, who am I? Mmm... Mmm...

459,Steal My Sunshine,Kidz Bop Kids,2001-10-09,"I was lying on the grass of Sunday morning of last week
Indulging in my self-defeat
My mind was thugged, all laced and bugged, all twisted, wrong and beat
A comfortable three feet deep
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there on a confusing morning week
Impaired my tribal lunar speak
And of course you can't become if you only say what you would have done
So I missed a million miles of fun

I know it’s up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet
(If you steal my sunshine)

I was frying on the bench slide in the park across the street
L-A-T-E-R that week
My sticky paws were into making straws out of big fat slurpy treats
An incredible eight-foot heap
Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tare in a staring under heat
Involved an under usual feat
And I'm not only among but I invite who I want to come
So I missed a million miles of fun

I know it’s up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet
(If you steal my sunshine)

I know it's done for me

Just sing along to my stereo

If I was just another dusty record on the shelve
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that
Like it read well, check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
Its just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to used to used to used to, now I'm over that
Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just Keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart is a stereo that only plays for you

Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops
And crank it higher everytime they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know we come and go like we're on the interstate
I think finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hear it, sing along and take me by the hands
Keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart is a stereo that only plays for you

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, cause we have the same nose, same clothes, home grown, the stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree house homes, we all would take the latter

Chinese food makes me sick

When girls stop by
For the summer

I like girls that
Wear Abercrombie & Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer

Hip-hop mama, spic n span
Met you one summer
And it all began
You're the best girl
That I ever did see
The great Larry Byrd, jersey 33
When you take a sip
You buzz like a hornet
Billy Shakespeare wrote
A whole bunch of sonnets
Call me when you miss me
'Cause I can't speak baby
Something in your eyes
Really drove me crazy
Now I can't forget you
And it makes me mad
You left one day
And never came back
Stayed all summer
Then went back home
Macualay Culkin wasn't home alone
Fell deep in love but
Now we ain't speaking
Michael J. Fox was Alex P. Keaton

Crushed rocks till I boogie
Used to hate school
So I had to play hookie
Always been hip to the be	-ball style
Known to act wild and
Make a girl smile
Love New Edition and the Candy Girl
Remind me of you
Because you rock my world
You come from Georgia
Where the peaches grow
They drink lemonade
And speak real slow
You love hip-hop
And rock 'n' roll
Dad took off when
You were four years old
There was a good man
Named Paul Revere
I feel much better baby
When you're near
You love Fun Dip and Cherry Coke
I like the way you laugh
When I tell a joke
When I met you
I said my name is Rich

There oh-so quick
Let you off the hook

Think about that summer
And I bug 'cause I miss it
Like the color purple
Macaroni and cheese
Ruby-red slippers
And a bunch of trees
Call you up but what's the use?
I like Kevin Bacon
But I hate Footloose
Came in the door

And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture

Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's a favorite song and mics don't feedback

Keep my hand in the fire, sooner or later
I'll get what I'm asking for

No matter what you say about life, about life
I learn every time I bleed, I bleed
That truth is a stranger, soul is in danger
I gotta let my spirit be free

To admit that I'm wrong
And then change my mind, change my mind
Sorry, but I have to move on
And leave you behind

I can't waste time so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry about everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one

Don't look back at a new direction
I loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo

Just like a tattoo, I'll always have you
I'll always have you

I'm sick of playing all of these games, these games
It's not about taking sides, taking sides
When I looked in the mirror, it didn't deliver
It hurt enough to think that I could stop

Admit that I'm wrong
And then change my mind, change my mind
Sorry, but I gotta be strong
And leave you behind

What I want and I need, everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
But I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do, why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do, why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus

That love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone
Or keep a straight face

And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I had sworn to myself
That I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

503,The Story Of Us,Kidz Bop Kids,2011-07-19,"I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
People would say they're the lucky ones
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
Oh a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fall-out
Too many things that I wish you knew
So many walls that I can't break through

[Chorus:]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say, it's a twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Next chapter
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
You're doing your best to avoid me
I started to think one day I'd tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

[Chorus:]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say, it's a twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like the careless
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you say you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wished I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

[Chorus:]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah

To terrorize y'all's neighborhood

Must stand and face the hounds of hell

And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom

What hurts the most was bein' so close
And havin' so much to say and watchin' you walk away
And never knowin' what could've been
And not seein' that lovin' you is what I was tryin' to do

It's hard to deal with the pain of losin' you everywhere I go
I'm doing it
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone

Still harder gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin' with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved
In my heart that I left unspoken

What hurts the most was bein' so close
And havin' so much to say and watchin' you walk away
And never knowin' what could've been
And not seein' that lovin' you is what I was tryin' to do, oh, oh

What hurts the most was bein' so close
And havin' so much to say and watchin' you walk away
And never knowin' what could've been
And not seein' that lovin' you is what I was tryin' to do

And you don't care what they say
See every time you turn around
They're screaming your name

Now I've got a confession
When I was young I wanted attention
And I promised myself that I'd do anything
Anything at all for them to notice me

But I ain't complaining, we all wanna be famous
So go ahead and say what you wanna say
You don't know what it's like to be nameless
Want them to know what your name is

When I grow up I wanna be famous
I wanna be a star, I wanna be in movies
When I grow up I wanna see the world
Drive nice cars, I wanna have groupies

When I grow up, be on TV
People know me, be on magazines
When I grow up, fresh and clean
Number one chick when I step out on the scene

Be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it
You just might get it, you just might get it
Be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it
You just might get it, you just might get it, get it

Until I popped up on the TV
I always wanted to be a superstar
Who knew that singing songs would get me this far?

571,Who Knew,Kidz Bop Kids,2008-02-19,"You took my hand, you showed me how
You promised me you'd be around
Uh huh, that's right

I took your words and I believed
In everything you said to me
Yeah huh, that's right

If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and call them loud
'Cause they're all wrong

I know better
'Cause you said forever and ever
Who knew?

Remember when we were such fools
And so convinced and just too cool
Oh no, no, no

I wish I could touch you again
I wish I could still call you friend
I'd give anything

When someone said count your blessings now
For they're long gone
I guess I just didn't know how
I was all wrong

They knew better
Still you said forever and ever
Who knew? Yeah, yeah

I'll keep you locked in my head
Until we meet again
Until we, until we, until we meet again
I won't forget you, my friend
What happened?

If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and call them loud
'Cause they're all wrong

And the last kiss, I'll cherish
Until we meet again
And time makes it harder
I wish I could remember

But I keep your memory
You visit me in my sleep, my darling
Who knew?

My darling, my darling
Who knew?
My darling, I miss you, my darling
Who knew? Who knew?",10,0.00392,0.665,0.544,0,0.0683,-7.309,0.035,0.277,140.04

574,Who Says You Can't Go Home,Kidz Bop Kids,2007-01-01,"I spent many years trying to get out of this place
I was lookin' for something I couldn't replace
I was runnin' away from the only thing I've ever known

Like a, a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold

I've been there, I done that
And I ain't lookin' back on the seeds I've sown
Saving dimes, spending too much time on the telephone
Who say's you can't go home

Who say's you can't go home
There's only one place, they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rolling-stone
Who say's you can't go home

Who say's you can't go back
Been around all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go
Who say's you can't go home

It's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright
It's alright

I went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I left a million miles of memories on that road

With every step I take I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known
Who say's you can't go home

Who say's you can't go home
There's only one place, they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rolling-stone
Who say's you can't go home

Who say's you can't go back

There's only one place left I want to go
Who say's you can't go home
Who say's you can't go home

I've been there, I done that
And I ain't looking back, it's been a long, long road
Feels like I've never left, that's how the story goes
Who say's you can't go home

It doesn't matter where you are, doesn't matter where you go
If it's a million miles aways or just a mile up the road
Take it in, take it with you when you go
Who say's you can't go home

Who say's you can't go back
Been around all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go

575,Why Don't You And I,Kidz Bop Kids,2004-02-24,"Since the moment I spotted you
Like walking around with little wings on my shoes
My stomach's filled with the butterflies
And it's alright

Bouncing round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If I said I didn't like it then you'd know I'd lie

Every time I try to talk to you I get tongue-tied
Turns out that everything I say to you
Comes out wrong, it never comes out right

So I say why don't you and I get together
Take on the world and be together forever
Heads we will, tails we'll try again

So I say why don't you and I hold each other
Fly to the moon and straight on to heaven
'Cause without you they're never gonna let me in

When's this fever gonna break?
I think I've handled more than any man can take
I'm like a love sick puppy chasing you around
And it's alright

Bouncing round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If I said I didn't like it then you'd know I'd lie

Every time I try to talk to you I get tongue-tied
Turns out that everything I say to you
Comes out wrong, it never comes out right

So I say why don't you and I get together
Take on the world and be together forever
Heads we will, tails we'll try again

So I say why don't you and I get together
Fly to the moon and straight on to heaven
'Cause without you they're never gonna let me in

Slowly I begin to realize
This is never gonna end
But about the same time you walk by
And I say, ""Oh, here we go again, oh""

Every time I try to talk to you I get tongue-tied
Turns out that everything I say to you
Comes out wrong, it never comes out right

So I say why don't you and I get together

He's so good and he knows it too well

But you can do the job when you're in town""

Seasons come and go but I will never change
And I am on my way

Lets go, yeah, you're listening now
They said they ain't heard nothing like this in a while
That's why they play my songs on so many different dials
'Cause I got more hits and I got more style
So when they see me everybody baraap baraap
Standing like a young gun fully backed and trapped
My criteria drops over the massive attack
I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat
Look at my jacket and hat so so berserk
So down to earth I'm bringing gravity back
Adopted by the major I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed
Look I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Mallory Black-man
(Where's all the world's sanity at?)
Man, I used to be the kid that no on cared about

I needed a break, for a sec I even gave up believing the same
I even done the legal stuff and was leaded astray
The say that money is the root to the evilest ways
But have you ever been so hungry it keeps you awake
May, now my hunger will leave them amazed, great
It feels like a long time coming, found
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream I tried to chase it but I wasn't goin' nowhere
Running round I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Tryna change a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyone's a kid that no one cares about
You just gotta screamin' till they hear you out

Remember the words you told me
""Love me 'til the day I fly""
Surrender my everything
'Cause you made me believe you're mine
Yeah, you used to call me baby
Now you're calling me by name (Mmm)
Takes one to know one, yeah
You beat me at my own big game

[Pre-Chorus]
You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take

[Chorus]
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
But I'm just a sad man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I’m just a sad man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Lately our conversations
End like it's the last goodbye
Then one of us gets too lost
And calls about a hundred times
So, who you been calling baby?
Nobody could take my place
When you're looking at those strangers
Like to think you see my face (Yeah, ooh, ooh)

[Chorus]
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
But I'm just a sad man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I’m just a sad man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Bridge]
You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take
You're running around and I'm running away
Running away from you, mmm, from you

[Chorus]
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
But I'm just a sad man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I’m just a sad man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Outro]
You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take
Youngblood
Say you want me
Say you want me out of your life

595,You're Beautiful,Kidz Bop Kids,2006-08-01,"My life is brilliant

My life is brilliant, my love is pure
I saw an angel, of that I'm sure
She smiled at me on a subway, she was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that 'cause I've got a plan

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do 'cause I'll never be with you

Yes, she caught my eye as we walked on by
She could see from my face that I was flying high
And I don't think that I'm see her again
But we shared a moment that will last till the end

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do 'cause I'll never be with you

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
There must be an angel with a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you

But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you",12,0.105,0.742,0.409,0,0.0939,-9.446,0.0276,0.216,82.007

I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I’m not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am, because I need to know
Ooh, whoa

[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
And you say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, oh you say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

[Verse 2]
The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me
In You I find my worth, in You I find my identity
Ooh, whoa

[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
And when I don’t belong, oh You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me

597,You've Got A Friend,Kidz Bop Kids,2004-01-01,"When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend",9,0.78,0.707,0.284,8.98e-06,0.228,-14.387,0.0276,0.68,93.665
